Taking the knee (or taking a knee) is a symbolic gesture against racism whereby an individual kneels upon one knee in place of standing to attention for an anthem or other such occasion. It was originated by American football player Colin Kaepernick on September 1, 2016, in protest against the lack of attention given to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. Kaepernick's protest led to a wider series of national anthem protests.[1] It has since been adopted by sports players in countries around the world, including association football in the United Kingdom, in solidarity with Kaepernick's protest against racism, and has been seen worldwide in non-sporting contexts such as the Black Lives Matter protests.[1][2]
U.S. national anthem kneeling protests[edit]
The gesture originated in a 2016 American football game, during which Colin Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid chose to kneel during the playing of the US national anthem, to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality.[3]
""After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest,"" said Reid. ""We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.""[3]
During the 2016 season, a small number of other players also took the knee before matches.[4] Taking a knee became more frequent after then-President Trump criticized the gesture during a rally in September 2017, describing it as a disrespectful act against the United States national anthem and flag, and urging NFL team owners to sack ""son of a bitch"" players who performed it. In response, over a hundred NFL players took the knee in subsequent weeks, along with athletes from other sports, and spectators.[4]
Use in association football[edit]
Taking the knee was used by many clubs before kick-off throughout the 2020–21 English association football season, which was booed by some fans.[5][6][7]
In a June 2020 radio interview, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that he saw the gesture as ""a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation"", adding that he was unaware whether it had a broader history and that it seemed to him to be ""taken from the Game of Thrones"".[8][9][10][11]
In September 2020, Middlesbrough said they would stop taking the knee.[12] In December 2020 players from Millwall and QPR said they would not take the knee, but would instead stand arm-in-arm.[13] By February 2021 other teams had stopped taking the knee, including Brentford,[14] while individual players from other teams such as Wilfried Zaha said they would also stop.[15] Zaha later became the first Premier League player to stop taking the knee.[16] Derby County stopped in March 2021.[17]
On June 8, 2021, prior to an international friendly game between Hungary and the Republic of Ireland, the Irish players were booed by some Hungarian fans prior to kick-off for taking the knee.[18]
The England national team took the knee before matches in 2021's UEFA European Football Championship,[19] resulting in booing from some fans.[20][21][22][23] Conservative MP Lee Anderson stated that he would not watch England games in the tournament as a direct result of this political gesture, saying he believed that ""the vast majority of these fans booing last night are not racist"" and thought they were ""more likely to [...] not share the Marxist views of BLM"".[24][25] Kick It Out's chief executive Tony Burnett considered the booing an example of racism in the sport.[26] The English Football Association later asked fans to respect the players' wishes to take the knee.[27] England players were booed by Poland fans for kneeling against racism ahead of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at National Stadium, Warsaw.[28]
In July 2021, Conservative MP Steve Baker said the Government should start backing players taking the knee,[29] after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel had declined to condemn those who booed.[30][31][32] Keir Starmer, Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Labour Party, said England's players were ""right to take the knee"".[33]
Ahead of the 2022–23 Premier League season, Premier League club captains agreed to their teams no longer taking the knee routinely before matches,[34] instead restricting the gesture to ""significant moments"" of the season.[35] Some captains felt that the gesture had lost its power, and hoped that restricting it would increase its impact.[36] Captains affirmed their commitment towards fighting racism and other forms of discrimination.[37] During the national anthem to start the 2022 FIFA World Cup game between England and Iran, England players took the knee as Iran’s players fell silent in reaction to events going on in their country.[38]
Similar gestures in history[edit]
Josiah Wedgwood pottered the image of a black man kneeling in shackles and depicting slavery on the emblem of the British abolitionist movement during the 18th and 19th centuries—a movement to ban slavery and ill-treatment of people.[39]
In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. knelt in prayer with a group of equalities marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches.[39]

The World Cup is a solid gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970, before the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. It is one of the most expensive trophies in sporting history, valued at $250,000.[1]
The first trophy, originally named Victory, but later renamed in honour of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and lapis lazuli. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil won the trophy outright in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.
The subsequent trophy, called the ""FIFA World Cup Trophy"", was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 karat gold with bands of malachite on its base, it stands 36.8 centimetres high and weighs 6.175 kilograms (30,875 carats).[2] The trophy was made by the Stabilimento Artistico Bertoni company[3] in Italy. It depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holders of the trophy are Argentina, winners of the 2022 World Cup.
Jules Rimet Trophy[edit]
The Jules Rimet Trophy was the original prize for winning the FIFA World Cup. Originally called ""Victory"", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base.[4] In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winner's details. It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb).[5] It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.[6]
During World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it.[7] The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers' requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.[8]
On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall.[9] It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white mongrel dog named Pickles.[10][11]
As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA.[12] The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica.[12] Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.[13]
The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930.[14] It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.[15]
On 19 December 1983, the wooden rear of the cabinet was opened by force with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again.[16] Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime.[17] The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold.[18] Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.[19]
The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb) of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president João Figueiredo in 1984.[17]
New trophy[edit]
A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries.[18][20] Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) or 30,875 carats of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kilograms (150–180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift.[21][22] This is easy to understand since 18 k gold is an alloy made of 18 parts of gold, 5 parts of silver and 1 part of copper with a mean density of 15.6 gr/cm3.[23][24] The trophy weighs 6175 g, this amount of alloy is just a volume of 390 cm3 or, in other words, would be a cube with a side of 7.3 cm, and the World Cup is clearly larger. This argumentation proves that the World Cup is indeed hollow. Moreover, its original manufacturer, who is the same that makes the official replicas, confirmed this characteristic.[25][26]
Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, ""The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory"".[18]
The trophy has the engraving ""FIFA World Cup"" on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zurich, Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final.[27] The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition.[28]
The Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, however, that is no longer the case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language. For example, ""1974 Deutschland"" or ""1994 Brasil"". In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as ""2010 Spain"", in English, not in Spanish.[29][30] This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup.[31]
As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners.[18] FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold.[18] Germany became the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[32] Argentina became the second nation to achieve this feat following their win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Eventual replacement[edit]
Since the base of the trophy only has space for new engravings to be made up until the 2038 World Cup, a new trophy will eventually be made for the 2042 World Cup.[33]

2,https://keepup.com.au/news/england-3-0-wales-rashford-and-foden-send-three-lions-through-as-group-b-winners-2/,"Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden starred to send England through to the World Cup knockout stage as Group B winners after a 3-0 victory over Wales on Tuesday.
Victory sets up a last-16 clash with Group A runners-up Senegal on Sunday for England, while Wales crashed out in Qatar without a win for the first time in a major tournament.
Foden started at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium after being left out of the goalless draw with the United States on Friday and won the free-kick for Rashford to break the deadlock in the 50th minute.
Manchester City star Foden extended the lead just a minute later before Rashford doubled his account to eliminate an uninspiring Wales from Group B, in which the USA beat Iran to progress as runners-up.

Rashford spurned a glorious ninth-minute opportunity after being denied by the onrushing Danny Ward, who replaced the suspended Wayne Hennessey.
England continued to dominate possession without testing Ward often as Foden blasted over on the turn, while Joe Allen angled a rare Wales chance off target before the break.
A masterful Foden drive ended with an England free-kick in an inviting position before Rashford whipped into the top-right corner to beat an unsighted Ward.
Harry Kane drilled across the area from the right soon after for Foden to convert at the back post, before Jordan Pickford parried from Kieffer Moore to keep Wales at bay.
Ward was again beaten with somewhat ease as Rashford powered through the legs of the goalkeeper, who denied Jude Bellingham to keep the scoreline down late on.
What does it mean? England continue Wales dominance to book last-16 berth
The pressure ramped upon England after an underwhelming showing in the USA stalemate but Southgate's side responded well in their first World Cup meeting with a fellow British side.
England remained patient throughout and reaped well-deserved rewards in a rapid second-half opening to ensure a seventh straight victory over Wales, scoring 14 and conceding just one in that run.
Knockout football is where England have impressed in recent years and Southgate will know it is time to deliver again, while Wales head home after disappointing in just their second appearance in the tournament.
Rashford redemption
Rashford will have been frustrated to chip a presentable opening at the incoming Ward in what proved to be England's best first-half chance.
But the forward made amends after the interval with two goals, while recording game-leading figures for touches in the opposition box (eight), shots (six) and attempts on target (four) in an encouraging showing.
Bale missing on the world stage
Gareth Bale had the fewest touches of any Wales players to complete 90 minutes in both games against the USA and Iran, though a penalty in the first outing somewhat sheltered the Wales captain from criticism.
The 33-year-old was again largely a passenger in the Middle East against England, managing just four passes and seven touches – both the fewest of any player to start – before his half-time removal.

Key Opta Facts:
– England have finished top of their World Cup group for the first time since 2006, when they were eventually eliminated by Portugal at the quarter-final stage.
– Wales are winless in their last eight games in all competitions (D2 L6), losing more games in this run than they did in their first 23 under Rob Page (W10 D8 L5).
– Marcus Rashford's second goal was England's 100th scored at the World Cup, while it made him just the second Manchester United player to score 3+ goals for the Three Lions at a major tournament after Bobby Charlton (1966 World Cup).
– England's nine goals so far at the 2022 World Cup is the most they've scored in the group stages at a single edition of a major tournament (World Cup and EUROs).
What's next?
England face Senegal in five days at Al-Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, while Wales will take time to reflect on an unsuccessful global campaign."

The Nottingham Forest ‘keeper becomes the 174th player to be sent off at a World Cup, but only the third goalkeeper, joining Gianluca Pagliuca (Italy vs Norway, 1994) and Itumeleng Khune (South Africa vs Uruguay, 2010).

The first-ever player to be sent off in a World Cup match was Peru’s Placido Galindo, against Romania in the 1930 tournament, but Carlos Caszely of Chile was the first player to actually be shown a physical red card when he was sent off against West Germany in 1974.
Here is everything you need to know about red cards at the World Cup…
Players with the most red cards
Throughout the competition, no player has ever been sent off multiple times in one tournament. However, since 1930, two players have been sent off more than once across multiple competitions. Rigobert Song, the current manager of Cameroon, has been sent off twice in the competition (against Brazil in 1994 and Chile in 1998), as has French icon Zinedine Zidane, who was sent off in the 2006 final against Italy, and less famously against Saudi Arabia in 1998.
Teams with the most red cards
Throughout the history of the World Cup, 64 nations have seen a player sent off. The countries with the most red cards in the competition are Brazil (11), Argentina (10), Uruguay (nine), Italy (eight) and Cameroon (eight).
Despite leading the way when it comes to the number of dismissals, Brazil have not picked up any red cards in the past two tournaments.

Referees who have shown the most red cards
Despite only officiating seven World Cup games across three tournaments, Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez issued five World Cup red cards, including two in one game during the 2006 group stage match between Serbia & Montenegro and Ivory Coast (Serbia’s Albert Nad and Ivory Coast’s Cyril Domoraud). French official Joel Quiniou has issued five red cards across his World Cup career, having refereed eight games. That included sending off Uruguay’s Jose Batista in the first minute of their 1986 match against Scotland for a robust challenge on Gordon Strachan.

However, it is Mexico’s Arturo Brizio Carter who holds not only the record for the most red cards shown at World Cups (seven), but also for having shown red cards in the most matches (five).

Red cards in World Cup finals
Across the history of the competition, there have been five red cards in finals, including in 2006 when Zinedine Zidane capped off his professional career by headbutting Marco Materazzi and being sent off in the 110th minute of his last-ever game. Other final dismissals include Dutchman John Heitinga’s against Spain in 2010, Marcel Desailly (France vs Brazil) in 1998, and the double sending-off of Argentina’s Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti against West Germany in 1990.
Of the infamous five, only Desailly ended the day with a winner’s medal. France had led 2-0 when he was sent off in the 68th minute and ended up winning 3-0.
Tournaments with the most red cards
Germany, 2006 (28)
In a way, Zidane’s headbutt was a fitting end to a tournament that was plagued with indiscipline. This competition saw 21 teams pick up at least one red card, with two matches seeing three red cards, and one seeing four.
That quartet of dismissals came during the now infamous Portugal vs Netherlands round-of-16 tie that saw two players sent off from each team (Deco and Costinha for Portugal, Khalid Boulahrouz and Giovanni van Bronckhorst for the Netherlands). Games between Croatia and Australia, and Italy and the USA both saw three red cards.
One of England’s most infamous red cards came in the quarter-finals when a young Wayne Rooney was dismissed for stamping on Portugal’s Ricardo Carvalho. The referee who showed him the red card — Horacio Elizondo of Argentina — also later sent off Zidane in the final.
As if that wasn’t enough madness for one year, English referee Graham Poll also made headlines for issuing three yellow cards to Croatia’s Josip Simunic in the aforementioned match against Australia. Poll failed to realise he had already booked Simunic when he showed him his second yellow card, then booked him a third time a few minutes later and finally showed the red.

France, 1998 (22)
This competition saw 22 red cards shown across 15 teams, with Cameroon and eventual winners France both picking up the most (three). There were three red cards shown in a game once, and two red cards shown in a game four times, the highest across all competitions to date.
The game that saw the most red cards was Denmark’s 1-1 draw with South Africa, where Miklos Molnar and Morten Wieghorst of Denmark, and South Africa’s Alfred Phiri were all sent off by referee John Toro Rendon of Colombia.
The most famous red card in the tournament was probably David Beckham’s in England’s last-16 defeat to Argentina. The Manchester United midfielder saw red for kicking out at Argentina’s Diego Simeone and was made a scapegoat for the defeat by sections of the English press.
South Korea & Japan, 2002 (17)
In 2002, Portugal and Paraguay were the leading offenders with two red cards apiece, with Mexican official Felipe Ramos Rizo making his presence known by issuing four red cards in just three matches. Four referees sent off more than one player in a game during the tournament. That included two for Portugal (Joao Pinto and Beto) in their controversial group stage defeat to co-hosts South Korea.
South Africa, 2010 (17)
The first tournament to take place in Africa saw 17 red cards issued across 13 teams, with Algeria, Australia, Brazil, and Uruguay having two red cards apiece.
The most famous was Luis Suarez’s against Ghana, a goal-line handball which denied Ghana what would surely have been a winner in added time at the end of extra time. Ghana missed the resulting penalty and then lost in the shootout, securing Suarez’s status as one of the most hated men in Ghana.

5,https://olympics.com/en/news/fifa-world-cup-2022-records-and-stats,"Get all the FIFA World Cup 2022 statistics, records, milestones and numbers from Qatar featuring football players Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Dani Alves and more.
The FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar came to a dramatic conclusion.
This football tournament brought together 32 top national teams from five confederations and produced no shortage of highlights and history.
From Cristiano Ronaldo's striking touch to Lionel Messi's World Cup goals and appearances to French superstar Kylian Mbappe, records were made with every passing game. And how about Morocco becoming the first African nation to reach the semi-finals?
Read on to discover which records have already been broken and the statistics that are sure to make you the toast of any World Cup conversation.
Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) when he netted home a penalty in Portugal’s 3-2 victory over Group H rivals Ghana.
At 37 years and 292 days old on 24 November, with that goal Ronaldo became the oldest player to score for Portugal at the World Cup.
He also holds the record for being the youngest, having scored for his nation at the 2006 World Cup at 21 years and 132 days old.
In taking to the pitch for the game against Ghana in Qatar, Ronaldo additionally joined Lionel Messi, Lothar Matthäus, Antonio Carbajal and Rafael Márquez as the only men to play in five different FIFA World Cups.
But CR7 had to leave Qatar without the coveted trophy after Portugal's shock ext in the quarter-finals after 1-0 loss to Morocco.
After scoring a fifth goal of this World Cup against Croatia, and his 11th overall, Lionel Messi smashed a new string of records for Argentina.
The 35-year-old is now the top-scorer for Argentina in World Cups, surpassing the previous record of Gabriel Batistuta (10), joint-sixth in all-time World Cup scorer charts, and the oldest man to score five goals in a single World Cup tournament.
The semi-final meeting with Croatia also saw him level Lothar Matthaus' record 25 World Cup appearances by a player before he overtook it in the final.
In the tournament's opening stages, Messi became the first player to score in four World Cups for Argentina (2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022) after he netted a penalty in an opening-round loss to Saudi Arabia.
In the final, he scored from the spot to become the first man to score in each of the knockout stages since the round of 16 was introduced at Mexico 1986.
He scored in extra time to make it seven for the tournament and 13 in World Cups. But more than any of that, he lifted the World Cup for the first time in his glorious career.
FIFA World Cup 2022: What records has Lionel Messi broken and what records is he closing in on?
With 10 minutes to go in the World Cup Final, Argentina led 2-0 with Messi on course for the one trophy to have eluded him.
Kylian Mbappe had other ideas.
First, he scored from the spot before sweeping home moments later to take the match into extra time.
And after his PSG teammate had put Argentina back in front, Mbappe converted another penalty to join Geoff Hurst as the only man to score a hat-trick in the World Cup Final and force a penalty shoot-out.
That took Mbappe's tally to eight for the tournament, securing the Golden Boot by one from Messi.
He had already eclipsed Pele as the highest World Cup goalscorer before the age of 24.
But that incredible effort proved in vain as Argentina won on penalties.
Spain’s No.9 Gavi became the first player born in the year 2004 to score a goal in Qatar when his country thumped Costa Rica 7-0 in their opening match of the tournament.
Incidentally, that victory is the record for the most goals Spain has ever scored in a single World Cup match.
He's done it!
With his goal at the end of the first half of France's round-of-16 clash against Poland, Olivier Giroud became France's all-time leading goalscorer with 52 goals, which he later extended to 53 with his headed winner in the quarter-final against England.
The 36-year-old drew level with Thierry Henry's previous mark of 51 when he scored twice in the 4-1 win over Australia.
Hot on the heels of Giroud's goal scoring feat, France's captain Hugo Lloris became his nation's record appearance maker.
The Tottenham goalkeeper won his 143rd cap in the quarter-final win over England, moving him ahead of Lilian Thuram.
Lloris took his tally to 144 in the semi-final against Morocco and then to 145 in the final.
Argentina came to Qatar unbeaten in 36 games, singling them out as one of the favourite to win the entire competition.
However, that run was shattered by the second-lowest ranked team at the tournament, Saudi Arabia, who defeated Argentina in 2-1.
Inaki Williams of Ghana and Nico Williams of Spain made FIFA World Cup history on 24 November after they became the first full siblings to play for different countries at the FIFA World Cup.
There's positive record-making and there's the less so, and unfortuantely for hosts Qatar, they claimed a first they might not want to brag too much about.
In losing their first match 2-0 Ecuador, Qatar became the first hosts of a FIFA World Cup to lose their opening match.
Wales' goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey became the first player at FIFA World Cup 2022 to see a red card after he collided with Iran's Mehdi Taremi.
The card shown was initially a yellow before it was upgraded to a red.
Hennessey is now the third goalkeeper in World Cup history to be sent off with a red card.
England and USA played out the fifth goalless draw of the FIFA World Cup 2022 on Friday (25 November). Six days later, Croatia and Belgium added another 0-0.
The other four goalless draws so far: Mexico 0-0 Poland, Denmark 0-0 Tunisia, Croatia 0-0 Morocco and South Korea 0-0 Uruguay. Meaning Qatar 2022 has set another record, eight teams drawing the opening game 0-0 in the same World Cup for the first time ever.
England's barren draw was the 22nd draw at World Cups which is a record. Italy is now second with 21 draws.
Enner Valencia's goal against the Netherlands was his sixth World Cup goal in a row for Ecuador - no other Ecuadorian player had scored in the meantime.
Valencia scored all three of Ecuador's goals in the group stage of the World Cup in 2014. The South American side did not qualify for the 2018 edition in Russia.
The 33-year-old joins a select group that includes Portugal's legend Eusebio in 1966, Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Russia's Oleg Salenko in 1994.
Robert Lewandowski was in tears after scoring his first World Cup goal in Poland’s 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia.
The Barcelona striker could not hide his emotions after doubling his side's lead with eight minutes remaining to seal victory for his side.
The 34-year-old had gone five World Cup games without a goal and missed a penalty in his team’s opening Group C game against Mexico.
Lewandowski now has over 600 career goals and equalled Pele's tally of 77 international strikes.
His consolation penalty deep into injury time of the round-of-16 defeat to France saw him go one clear of the Brazilian legend.
Portugal's 39-year old centre-back Pepe has become the second oldest outfield player in World Cup after starting in his country's 2-0 win over Uruguay, Cameroon's Roger Milla remains the oldest as he suited up in the World Cup 1994 in the USA aged 42.
Egypt's goalie Essam El-Hadary is still the record holder. He was 45 when he played in the World Cup 2018.
And Pepe also became the second oldest player to score at a World Cup when he headed in a corner for a 2-0 lead in the 6-1 win over Switzerland.
Stephanie Frappart will become the first woman in history to officiate a men's World Cup match when Germany play Costa Rica on Thursday (1 December).
The 38-year-old was already the fourth official in Mexico's game with Poland earlier in the tournament.
Marcus Rashford was the man of the hour in England's World Cup victory over Group B rivals Wales.
The 25-year-old Manchester United player contributed two goals in his country's 3-0 rout s and with his efforts, guaranteed England advanced to the knockout stages on top of their pool.
Notably, Rashford's second goal of the game, a left-footed strike that clipped the keeper's heel, was England's 100th FIFA World Cup goal.
The first goal for the English at the tournament was netted by Stan Mortensen in 1950.
Other countries to have scored 100 goals or more at a World Cup include Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain.
23-year-old Cody Gakpo is the first ever Dutch player to score in all of Netherlands' group stage games at a World Cup.
The PSV Eindhoven striker clinched the record when he opened scoring for Netherlands in their third group stage against Qatar on Tuesday (30 November).
At 37 years and 247 days old, French goalkeeper Steve Mandanda became the oldest player in history to represent France when he started for Les Bleus against Tunisia on Wednesday 30 November.
Dani Alves has accomplished another record in his glittering career. The 39-year-old full-back has become Brazil's oldest captain when he led the record world champion to the field in their clash against Cameroon.
38-year-old Thiago Silva previously held the record for oldest men’s captain and Brazilian male player to star at a World Cup when he started in Brazil’s opening round win against Serbia (2-0). Alves has now surpassed him.
But Silva made World Cup history on his own as the Chelsea star bagged an assist during Brazil's 4-1 win against the Republic of Korea thus becoming the oldest player to assist a goal at the tournament.
Morocco has reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in history after beating Portugal 1-0 on Saturday (10 December).
In doing so, the Atlas Lions became the first African country ever to advance to the World Cup semis. They have only conceeded one goal so far.
And Morocco are clinical from the spot too, with their goalie Yassine Bounou (aka Bono) saving two penalties in the epic 3-0 shootout win over Spain in the last 16. Achraf Hakimi - born and raised in Madrid - converted the decisive penalty for Morocco.
Hard to believe that Walid Regragui only took over as Morocco's coach in August.
Gonçalo Ramos, who started in place of the benched Cristiano Ronaldo, was the star of the show in the quarter-finals opening the scoring just 17 minutes into his competition debut.
The Benfica striker scored the first hat-trick of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and made global headlines.
Spanish referee Antonio Lohoz handed out a record 16 yellow cards to players during Argentina's intense quarter-final win over the Netherlands which went to penalties.
The previous record was 12 yellow cards which were given out in the games Senegal v Uruguay and Cameroon v Germany in the 2022 World Cup, as well as in the 2010 World Cup final between Span and the Netherlands.
Lohoz also yellow-carded Argentina's coach Lionel Scaloni and his assistant coach Walter Samuel. The only player to receive two yellows was Dutch star Denzel Dumfries, the second coming AFTER Lautaro Martinez had converted the decisive penalty in the shootout."

7,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/world-cup-roundup-italy-north-macedonia-portugal-turkey,"Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.
Italy did not qualify for the World Cup four years ago, missing out for the first time since 1958, but the European champions dominated from the off in Palermo. The hosts became more desperate in their search for a winner after the break, however, as chances continued to come and go before, in stoppage time, Trajkovski arrowed in a stunning winner to spark wild North Macedonian celebrations.
Roberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.
“It is a huge disappointment,” the Italy midfielder Jorginho said. “It hurts, it hurts so much. We have always created and dominated matches but we have not been able to finish teams off. It is not to blame anyone in particular but it is the reality.
“I don’t know why we haven’t been able to do this, I am also involved in this, and it hurts me to think about it.”
Without the veteran pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini through injury, Italy’s makeshift defence was barely troubled in the first half, as all the action took place down the other end.
Domenico Berardi had the best of the openings, having been presented with the ball after the North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski misplaced a pass, but his shot was tame, with Dimitrievski getting back to make the save. Ciro Immobile also wasted a glorious first-half chance for Italy when blazing over the bar from a good position.
Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance. Italy did not look to be in too much danger, but Trajkovski, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Fayha, wrote his name into North Macedonian football folklore with a shot that crept inside the post to stun the home fans.
Portugal moved into the final with a 3-1 win over Turkey, for whom Burak Yilmaz skied a penalty five minutes from full time that would have drawn the sides level.
Roared on by a sold-out Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal dominated the game from the start and went 2-0 up in the first half after Otavio scored one goal and created another for Diogo Jota before half-time. But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.
José Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty given by VAR but Yilmaz fired it high over the bar. The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.
The Sweden substitute Robin Quaison struck in the second half of extra time to secure a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and set up a clash away to Poland.
The Czechs had an early goal ruled out for a foul and the Swedes had the lion’s share of possession for most of the playoff semi-final, but the two sides struggled to break each other down in a game full of tough tackling and wayward passing.
The substitute Mattias Svanberg went closest for the Swedes in normal time, but his header from Emil Forsberg’s corner was aimed straight at the visiting goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.
The game finished scoreless after 90 minutes and appeared to be heading for penalties when Quaison danced through the middle of the defence before exchanging passes with Alexander Isak and coolly slotting home to move his side a step closer to Qatar."

The competition - which started out in Saudi Arabia as the King Fahd Cup - was originally introduced on a biennial basis between 1992 and 2001, before being moved to the World Cup hosts as it eventually became an event which took place every four years.
Why does it no longer form part of the footballing calendar, who can claim to have collected the crown and could it be brought back in the future? GOAL takes a look at all of those questions...
What happened to the Confederations Cup?
In 2019, it was confirmed by FIFA that the Confederations Cup would be consigned to the history books.
The tournament had featured the holders of the World Cup and the continental champions from across the six FIFA regions – AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA.
The competition was last staged in 2017, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with a revision to the international calendar made prior to Qatar 2022.
FIFA took the decision to do away with the Confederations Cup as they instead look to expand the Club World Cup.
That event is set to feature 24 teams heading forward, although the new format had to be shelved in 2021 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the need to reschedule Euro 2020 and the Copa America.
Some may consider it a good thing that the Confederations Cup is no longer up for grabs as no side that collected the trophy went on to savour ultimate glory at the following World Cup finals.
Confederations Cup history: Winners, finals and hosts
The competition became known as the FIFA Confederations Cup in 1997, but continued to be held in the Middle East at that point.
Brazil are the most successful side in the competition's history, claiming top prize on four occasions - including a run of three successive triumphs between 2005 and 2013.

Could the Confederations Cup be revived?Getty
While FIFA are eager to implement grander club competitions, there has been plenty of discussion regarding more frequent international events.
Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who is now FIFA’s chief of global football development, attracted criticism for suggesting that the World Cup could be staged every two years.
While that proposal appears to be off the table for now, a revival of the Confederations Cup – or something similar – could be looked into by world football’s governing body.
FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani told Reuters in December 2021: “The principle of having an event, in between World Cups, is something I am totally for.
“The question is what is that going to be, how do we look at it, how does that affect other things like qualification processes and tournaments that are already there? That is the process that we need to go through.”
He added: “We used to have something in between the World Cups, which was the old Confederations Cup.
“It wasn't a tournament that everyone was turned on to but for some confederations it was a nice link between your regional competition and an international competition and we lost that.
“Four or five years ago we had discussions over a 'Global Nations League’ so these discussions are not foreign to the table.
“They might look different, whether it is a Global Nations League, a Confederations Cup or Arsene's idea of a biennial World Cup, these are events that occur in between the current World Cup cycles.”"

LUSAIL, Qatar (AP) — Kylian Mbappé scored a hat trick seemingly from out of nowhere to electrify the World Cup final, he ended the tournament as the leading scorer with eight goals, and he still missed out on winning a second straight title.
The France superstar was on the losing side of an epic final against Argentina that was settled in a penalty shootout after a 3-3 draw on Sunday. He was then consoled on the field by French President Emmanuel Macron.
“Kylian has really left his mark on this final,” France coach Didier Deschamps said.
Mbappé had been the leader France desperately needed as time was running out with the defending champions trailing 2-0 and playing poorly. The forward had also been almost invisible up to that point.
But his goals carried France back into the match — twice. First, late in regulation time. Then again deep in extra time.
Mbappé converted a penalty in the 80th minute and then scored with a volley from just inside the area in the 81st.
It took only 97 seconds for him to get France even with Argentina and the great Lionel Messi.
Mbappé scored a second penalty in extra time, about 10 minutes after Messi had given Argentina the lead again in what became a compelling duel between the two players.
Mbappé’s hat trick was only the second in a World Cup final — the other was by England striker Geoff Hurst in 1966.
The Frenchman leaves Qatar with the Golden Boot trophy as the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals. At the age of 23, he’s matched Pelé’s career total of 12 World Cup goals.
But Mbappé couldn’t quite match the Brazil great’s back-to-back World Cup titles — both players were teenagers when they won their first one, Pelé in 1958 and Mbappé in 2018.
One minute before Mbappé turned the game on its head, Argentina’s fans began to taunt him.
Chants of “Olé, Olé” rained down from the stands at Lusail Stadium as Mbappé futilely chased the ball while his opponents passed it over and around him.
Mbappé gestured in frustration with his right arm at the apparent hopelessness of the situation.
But after scoring his first two goals, Mbappé surged into the Argentina half looking for a game-winning third. His darting, twisting run resulted in a shot deflected just too high.
Once he eventually got the hat trick to make it 3-3 in extra time, Mbappé set out for a fourth. His curling cross barely eluded the head of substitute Randal Kolo Muani, and a final dribble deep into the Argentina penalty area was scrambled clear as he looked to shoot.
He shouted out loud as his last attempt to win the game single-handedly slipped away.
Mbappé tried to set the tone in the penalty shootout, taking responsibility for the first kick. He converted the penalty but France still ended up losing 4-2. Messi did the same for Argentina to start the shootout, but his teammates all scored their penalties.
During the shootout, Mbappé made sure he was the first to console Kingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni on their slow walks back to the center circle after their failures to score.
Mbappé stood bent over in the center circle, hands on his knees, as Argentina defender Gonzalo Montiel prepared to take the decisive kick. He then squatted, saw the net ripple and walked away alone amid the Argentina celebrations.
Deschamps eventually came over behind his player to put arms around his neck. Mbappé soon went to the team dugout and sat slumped in a chair with his dark blue shirt pulled up over his face to hide his emotions.
Long after the game was over, Mbappé left the stadium with his head bowed and the World Cup trophy securely in the hands of Messi.

Founded in 1904 to provide unity among national soccer associations, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) boasts 209 members, rivaling that of the United Nations, and is arguably the most prestigious sports organization in the world.
FIFA was established on May 21, 1904, by seven national associations — Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland — to “promote the game of Association Football (as opposed to rugby or American football), to foster friendly relations among National Associations, Confederations, and their officials and players, by promoting the organization of football matches at all levels, and to control every type of association football by taking steps as shall be deemed necessary or advisable.”
FIFA’s birth was a result of the growing number of international games shortly after the dawn of the 20th century. Soccer leaders in Europe felt that such expanded competition required a governing body, and under the leadership of Robert Guerin, a French journalist, the seven founding members gathered in Paris to shape the future of the sport. Guerin, FIFA’s first president, presided over the organization from 1904 to 1906. Seven other men have also served as FIFA president, including Jules Rimet for 33 years from 1921 to 1954.
Currently, Italy’s Gianni Infantino serves as FIFA president, having been elected in 2016’s Extraordinary Congress held in the wake of corruption allegations against numerous FIFA Officials that resulted in former president Joseph “Sepp” Blatter stepping aside and then being banned from FIFA by its Ethics Committee. FIFA’s general secretary since 2009, Infantino will serve a three-year term as FIFA president.
Under FIFA’s governance soccer has become the world’s most popular sport. According to the Federation’s 2006 “Big Count,” the game is played by more than 150 million registered athletes — including 10 million women — and viewed by billions of fans in stadiums and on television worldwide. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil was broadcast in more than 200 countries. Inside the stadiums, a total of 3,429,873 spectators attended the 64 matches – an average of 53,592 per match – the second highest aggregate attendance behind USA 1994 (68,991).
As soccer’s ultimate administrative authority, FIFA governs all facets of the game: regulating the rules of play, overseeing the transfers of players internationally, organizing international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, establishing standards for refereeing, coaching and sports medicine, and encouraging soccer’s development around the world.
Among the official world championships staged by FIFA are the World Cup, the Women’s World Cup, the Under-20 World Cup, the Under-20 Women’s World Cup, the Under-17 World Cup, the Under-17 Women’s World Cup, the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and the Futsal World Cup. Additionally, FIFA oversees the men’s and women’s Olympic Football Tournament staged under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee every four years. FIFA has also staged the FIFA Confederations Cup, a competition between each of its confederations' champions, and the FIFA Club World Cup, which was held at the beginning of 2000 for the first time in Brazil

The 86-year-old monarch ""orders that tomorrow, Wednesday, be a holiday for all employees in the public and private sectors, as well as male and female students at all educational levels"", the Al-Ekhbariya channel said on Twitter.
The move comes in the middle of final exams in the Gulf nation, indicating that they will have to be rescheduled.
The Saudi Green Falcons bounced back from conceding an early Lionel Messi penalty to produce one of the greatest World Cup shocks thanks to a Saleh Al-Shehri equaliser and a sublime Salem Al-Dawsari winner at the Lusail Stadium in Doha.
Celebrations in Riyadh
Celebrations erupted throughout the capital Riyadh after the final whistle blew, with fans forming impromptu dance circles and waving the sword-emblazoned national flag from the windows of speeding cars.
Al-Ekhbariya posted pictures of King Salman's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, celebrating after watching the game with a group that included energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.
Turki al-Sheikh, an adviser at the Royal Court and head of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, announced on Twitter that admission fees would be waived at major theme parks and entertainment centres in Riyadh on Tuesday.
Few could have predicted that Herve Renard's Green Falcons, ranked 51st in the world, would topple the twice-world champions led by the feted Messi, who has seven Ballons d'Or to his name.
The team's next match is on Saturday against Poland."

Portuguese soccer star Pepe became the oldest player to ever score in the knockout stage of the World Cup Tuesday after his goal against Switzerland—the latest in a series of records and tournament firsts happening in Qatar.
Key Facts
Pepe, who will turn 40 in February, scored with a header off a corner kick in the first of half of the match, bringing the score to 2-0 at halftime.
Meanwhile, England’s 19-year-old Jude Bellingham became the first player born in the 21st century to score a goal in a World Cup match, during his team’s group stage match against Iran.
The Qatar tournament also features the first set of full siblings to compete for different teams, with Iñaki Williams representing Ghana and his younger brother, Nico Williams, making his World Cup debut for Spain (the Williams brothers were born in Spain to a Ghanaian father and Liberian mother, and Iñaki previously played for Spain).
French soccer referee Stéphanie Frappart led the first all-female refereeing trio in a men’s World Cup match last week, joined by assistants Neuza Back from Brazil and Karen Diaz from Mexico to officiate the match between Costa Rica and Germany on Thursday, FIFA announced this week.
Canadian coach John Herdman is the first manager in World Cup history to have led both a men's and a women's team at the tournaments, having previously coached the New Zealand women’s team in the 2007 and 2011 women’s World Cups.
When Qatar lost to Ecuador earlier this month, it was the first time in World Cup history that a host team lost its opening match.
Key Background
The Qatar World Cup is the first ever held in the Middle East, and the most expensive in the tournament’s history, with Qatar spending an estimated $220 billion over the past decade to prepare, including constructing seven new stadiums in which to hold matches. Because of the hot Qatari climate, the tournament is also the first to be held in winter instead of the usual summer schedule, which has disrupted club lineups in other countries. FIFA’s decision to hold the World Cup in Qatar has drawn controversy due to the country’s human rights record, and after scores of migrant workers died while working on World Cup-related construction projects. Qatar and FIFA officials have also been accused of bribery and corruption in voting to hold the tournament in the country.

 Egypt lose on penalties again as Senegal reach World Cup 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hatem Maher  , Tuesday 29 Mar 2022 
 Egypt were once again haunted by a shootout against Senegal, losing 3-1 on penalties following a 1-1 aggregate draw on Tuesday to miss out on a World Cup spot as the reigning African champions pipped them to a place in Qatar.  
 
 Senegal players celebrate a goal scored by teammate Idrissa Gana Gueye, during the World Cup 2022 - Africa playoff soccer match between Senegal and Egypt at at Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade stadium in Dakar, Senegal, Tuesday, March 29, 2022. AP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sadio Mane, just like he did in last month's Nations Cup final in Cameroon, converted the winning penalty with a powerful shot down the middle to spark jubilant scenes at the new 50,000-seater Abdoulaye Wade Stadium near the capital Dakar.

 Egypt's spot-kick specialists Mohamed Salah and Ahmed Zizo astonishingly missed the team's first two efforts, failing to capitalize on equally opening misses from Senegal's Kalidou Koulibaly and Saliou Ciss. 
 Another wasted kick from Egypt striker Mostafa Mohamed, who saw his tame shot come off the outstretched legs of Edouard Mendy, condemned the Pharaohs to a cruel loss as they failed to make back-to-back World Cup appearances for the first time. 
 Several Egypt players wept following the final whistle, with Mane upstaging the subdued Salah once again in another eye-catching duel between the Liverpool teammates. 
 In a scenario similar to Egypt's 1-0 first-leg win in Cairo, striker Boulaye Dia bundled home the opener from four yards out early on after a free-kick was met with a half-hearted defensive clearance. 
 A physical game then unfolded, with both sides struggling to string passes together in a first half low on quality. 
 Egypt vastly improved after the break, threatening on several occasions although Senegal's Ismaila Sarr also spurned a glorious chance for the hosts. 
 Senegal were in control in extra time as Egypt were indebted to goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shennawi for denying some near-certain goals, with Mane and Sarr wreaking havoc down both flanks. 
 Early goal  
 After Ciss's early own goal gave Egypt a first-leg advantage on Friday, it was Senegal's turn to also find the net after four minutes as the passionate home fans, who occasionally threw bottles onto the pitch, were in delirium. 
 A free-kick was floated to the far post, where a poor headed clearance by left-back Ahmed Fattouh fell to Villarreal striker Dia to drill home off El-Shennawi from close range. 
 It was then a scrappy and tense affair as too many fouls and some flying tackles disrupted the flow of the game and cost Egypt two substitutions, with central defender Rabia making way for Ahly teammate Ayman Ashraf and right-back Omar Gaber replaced for natural central midfielder Emam Ashour. 
 Egypt's long balls were easily dealt with by Senegal's rearguard, which had a torrid time in the second half nevertheless. 
 A triple substitution paid off as Egypt were reinvigorated, with Zamalek winger Zizo in particular unsettling Senegal's defence with his pace and trickery. 
 Egypt had three chances to sucker-punch Senegal, who were on the back foot for most of the second half. 
 On 51 minutes, Mahmoud Trezeguet was foiled by Chelsea keeper Mendy on the left hand side of the area after a threaded pass from Salah while Zizo could have scored with his first effort after coming on, leaping above his marker and heading just wide following an inswinging cross from Salah on 71 minutes. 
 Zizo threatened again a few minutes later after cutting inside from the left, his low shot narrowly missing the target. 
 But the second half's best chance came at the other end, with Sarr missing a sitter eight minutes from time when he broke clear and beat the offside trap following a defence-splitting pass from Mane, only to drag his shot wide with the goal at his mercy. 
 Senegal then pinned Egypt into their own half in the first half of extra time and could have settled the tie in their favour had it not been for El-Shennawi. 
 The towering Ahly goalie tipped over a header from Pape Abou Cisse and made a superb reflex save to thwart a goal-bound shot from Sarr after Mane had found them unmarked with a couple of inviting crosses. 
 The shootout marked a fitting end, with Salah blasting his effort high over and Mane stealing the show with a composed kick.

17,https://olympics.com/en/news/fifa-world-cup-2022-qualified-football-teams-list,"A total of 32 teams have qualified for the 2022 football World Cup, which starts in November.
The FIFA World Cup 2022 is set to be hosted in Qatar in November this year.
Over 200 countries from across the world attempted to qualify in the quadrennial football event but only 32 teams, including hosts Qatar, made the cut the 2022 football World Cup.
Here, we look at all the teams that will be a part of the FIFA World Cup 2022, which starts from November 21, 2022.
A total of 32 teams have qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2022, with Qatar earning automatic qualification, courtesy of being the hosts.
Five-time champions Brazil were the first team from South America to qualify for the event, while Germany were the first European nation to confirm their spot for the Qatar World Cup.
Brazil, who last won the FIFA World Cup in 2002, advanced through the CONMEBOL’s qualification tournament, which includes nine other teams. The Selecao have featured in every World Cup to date.
Lionel Messi’s Argentina, who won the Copa America last year, have also made it through.
Meanwhile, in Europe, Denmark, France, Belgium, Croatia, England, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland and Wales are the teams that will be joining Germany at the World Cup after topping their respective groups in the first round of qualifiers.
However, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal missed the direct spot after being stunned by Serbia in the final group match but qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2022 through the playoffs. Four-time champions Italy, though, failed to qualify after losing to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-finals.
In all, 13 teams from Europe qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2022.
On the other hand, six teams from Asia, five from Africa, four each from North America and South America made it to the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. No team made it from the Oceania region.
Wales qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 64 years after they defeated Ukraine 1-0 in the the intercontinental playoffs. Costa Rica booked the last spot after they beat New Zealand in June.

Embolo did not celebrate after his goal and the reason behind his muted celebrations is because he is a Cameroon national by birth. After his parents separated when he was five, he moved to France with his mother and eventually shifted to Switzerland the following year.
Cameroon vs Switzerland LIVE updates
Embolo, in 2014, became a naturalised Swiss national and made his professional debut for Swiss Super League club FC Basel that year.
The 25-year old then moved to German club Schalke 04 in 2016 and went on to play for Borussia Monchengladbach in 2019 on a four-year contract. In the 132 appearances he made in Bundesliga, he scored 28 goals and turned provider for 29 goals. “I’m probably 60 or 70 per cent Swiss now, even more so than I’m African.” said Embolo in an interview to Bundesliga last year.
Embolo currently plays for Monoco in Ligue 1 and has scored eight goals in 23 appearances in all competitions this season. He also has four assists towards his name."

Portugal, which thrashed Switzerland 6-1 in their Round of 16 match, did not include Ronaldo after coach Fernando Santos decided to bench the player. The move was made after Santos learned about Ronaldo's fit after being called to the bench to be substituted.
Portugal started brightly without Ronaldo and annihilated the Swiss team in a game that resembled match practice. Ronaldo himself entered the field in the second half but did not add to his tally in this year's FIFA World Cup.
When asked about Ronaldo's role following his benching for the Round of 16 game, Santos said it was still being defined.
In a press conference, Santos said, ""That is still something that has to be defined. I have a very close relationship with him - I always have, I have known him since he was 19 years old.”
""This relationship only develops, Ronaldo and I never interpret the human aspect of that of manager and player (in relation to) what we have to do during the match. I will always consider in my role that he is an important player to have in the team,"" the coach added.
When asked if he would start against a determined Morocco in the competition's quarterfinal, Santos gave the impression that the player might sit out the contest.
""Ronaldo will definitely (be involved), all the players on the bench can be used, if they are not in the starting line-up they can play later. It is important to look at the example of this player's history, he is one of the best players in the world at playing professionally, being captain - all we have to do is think about this team collectively,"" Santos concluded.
Ronaldo came off the bench in the second half to replace Joao Felix as Portugal defeated Switzerland 6-1 at the Lusail Stadium in the round of 16.
Georgina Rodriguez, Ronaldo's stunning partner, broke her silence on social media after the 37-year-old Portugal captain was dropped for the match against Switzerland.
Georgina chastised Portugal's manager in an Instagram post for not allowing Ronaldo to play for 90 minutes. ""Portugal 🇵🇹♥️💚 While the 11 players sang the anthem all goals placed on you. What a shame he didn't get to enjoy the best player in the world for the 90 minutes. The fans haven't stopped claiming you and screaming your name.""
""I hope God and your dear friend Fernando hold hands and make us vibrate one more night,"" her post read.

But the forward was ruled out of the Qatar 2022 with a thigh injury, which he sustained during a pre-tournament training camp.
France coach Didier Deschamps then decided not to replace Benzema in his World Cup squad, leaving the reigning champions with 25 players for their title defence.
Though there were reports that Benzema might make a comeback into the team’s World Cup plans after making a dramatic recovery, as suggested by reports from France, he was later spotted holidaying at the Indian Ocean island of Reunion.
When asked about Benzema, who is still officially part of the France squad at the World Cup, Deschamps dismissed the question.
“You are fishing for things there, but these things are not on my mind. I don’t know who is saying what, where or how,” the France coach said at a press conference in Doha ahead of Wednesday’s final group game against Tunisia.
“I spoke to Karim after his departure, and you know what his situation is and how long he will be out for. I am focusing on the 24 players who are here. I’ll let you talk about that and debate it if you want, but I am not going to talk about things that don’t affect what we are doing here from day to day.”
Benzema returned to the national side for last year’s European Championship, after having missed France’s title-run in 2018, following a disciplinary issue

Morocco vs Portugal Live score: A extraordinary result
Ronaldo has stormed off the pitch, he seemed to breaking out into tears even before he reached the touchline. This is surely the last time we see him in the World Cup or, indeed, in a Portugal shirt. The Moroccans are dancing on the ground and some have their families with them as well. What a tournament this has been for them. That's it from here but do stay tuned for the second match of the day between England and France. Ciao!

Morocco become the first African team to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. Portugal are out. Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva, Pepe, Ruben Neves, Diogo Dalot; all knocked out. It is Morocco, the extraordinary Morocco who have still not let an opposition score against them in this World Cup, who reach the semi-finals. Ghana had come within inches of the semis spot back in 2010 but couldn't quite break the glass ceiling for African nations. Now, Morocco have broken it and how. The teams that have failed to beat them are as follows: 2018 runners-up Croatia (0-0), FIFA World No.2 Belgium (lose 2-0), new boys Canada (lose 2-1), 2010 champions and footbal royalty Spain (0-0, lose on penalties) and now 2016 European champions Portugal.

However, instead of looping it in, Fernandes sends it along the ground to Silva who seems to be caught out by the pace of the pass. He reaches out with his leg and the ball goes wide of the far post. Silva was in all kinds of space there and that would have been a goal had he managed to control it.

FIFA World Cup live score: The Moroccan goal
That was a mix of an excellent jump from En-Nesyri and some weak goalkeeping from Diogo Costa. Yahiya Attiyat Allah, who has been a real nuisance for the Portuguese defence, sent a cross into the Portuguese area. Costa caught in two minds for a second and so he is late to arrive while trying to fist the ball out. En-Nesyri beats him in the air and heads it into the now unguarded goal.

Portugal started off with a thrilling 3-2 win over Ghana and then a rather straightforward 2-0 win over Uruguay. Those two results pretty much confirmed their passage into the knockouts, so much that even a stunning 2-1 loss to South Korea could not knock them out. Then they gave Switzerland a 6-1 hiding in the round of 16 and here they now are, looking to unlock the Moroccan puzzle.

Portugal vs Morocco Live score: Combative Santos
Fernando Santos was pretty assertive when stating that rumours of Ronaldo wanting to leave the World Cup after being told that he won't be starting against South Korea were false. ""He has never told me that he wanted to leave the team. I think it's high time we stopped this conversation,"" Santos said. “An example of what I just said is what he did in the match. He started warming up with the players, he warmed up with colleagues and celebrated all goals scored. At the end he invited colleagues to thank fans. It's high time for you to leave Ronaldo alone for what he has done for Portuguese football.”

Morocco vs Portugal Live score: Hello and welcome!
Ronaldo is on the bench again but that may not be much of a surprise considering how Portugal played without him in the last match and what his replacement Goncalo Ramos did. The Benfica youngster scored a hat-trick in what was his first-ever major tournament for Portugal. Ronaldo seems to have made piece with the fact that his age may not allow him to be a starter in the national side, stating that he would be more than happy if the team wins the World Cup with him not scoring a single goal for them here on out."
27,https://dohanews.co/feeling-depressed-here-is-how-you-can-cope-with-post-world-cup-blues/,"Post-World Cup depression is a common psychological condition among many football enthusiasts and athletes, which is used to describe the psychological void experienced by fans following the end of a major tournament.
Feeling frustrated? Irritated? Losing interest in things what used to make you happy? It could be post-World Cup sadness.
The World Cup in Qatar was joyful while it lasted, but after a month of celebrations, Qatar residents are now faced with the overwhelming question of: how do you move on without the World Cup?
Whether you are a football fan or not, for Doha residents the past ten years have primarily revolved around the World Cup.
Many monuments were built for the major event that did not exist before, from the construction of stadiums to Lusail city. Now that the tournament is over, it is hard to imagine life without the 1.4 million fans who flocked to the streets of Doha a few weeks ago.
“Before the World Cup, there were limited things to do in Qatar,” Maryam, a therapist at Hamad Hospital told Doha News.
“This event made people try to go to different shows, concerts, etc. It was not just football. It was fashion shows. It was concerts nearly every single day. Food stalls. Meeting new cultures every day. When that’s taken away from you suddenly, people will obviously react in a sad way,” she said, explaining why post-World Cup sadness is common after major events.
By definition, post-World Cup depression or post-tournament depression is a term that has recently gained popularity, describing the state of mind experienced by fans following the conclusion of the World Cup, which some compare to the feelings of returning to work after a long vacation.
According to experts, some of the symptoms that might occur are similar to mild symptoms of depression, which include moodiness, sadness and laziness, in which one may also find themselves avoiding work and tending to spend all their time at home surfing the internet or avoiding people.
“Post-World Cup depression is not the same as clinical depression, which is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest that can go on for six months and above,” Maryam explained; adding that although post-World Cup sadness might develop into severe depression over time, this is generally a seasonal condition when people are trying to cope and transition after a major event.
If you’re a football fan, you probably developed a routine in which you planned your day around the games. However, now that the World Cup has ended, many people are left with nothing to do or look forward to.
How to cope with post-World Cup depression
According to Trish Bedford, an art-psychotherapist based in Qatar, the first step is to acknowledge that post-World Cup depression is temporary unless you have pre-existing mental health conditions.
“For people who already had mental health issues like anxiety and severe depression before the World began, post-World cup sadness or depression is likely to affect them even more due to different reasons and should seek mental health support,” she explained.
“But if you are feeling sad suddenly because your team lost the World Cup or because you are just struggling to go back to a routine after the end of the tournament, then the process is different,” she said.
When a team you support during a tournament score a goal, your brain releases a chemical called dopamine. The routine of watching high-intensity sports over a significant period of time makes your body get used to high dopamine levels, which can make you feel happy and excited.
The imminent boredom that follows the end of the tournament decreases dopamine levels, causing depressing feelings including tiredness, mood swings, lack of motivation to do daily tasks and other common symptoms, Bedford explained.
“I would recommend doing activities that can increase dopamine or make you feel happy, to avoid falling into a huge depressive episode after,” she said.
Some of activities that can increase your dopamine include, but are not limited to:
- Depending on what you like can include: watching movies or going out with friends. This will allow you to have something to look forward to.
- Create meaning in your life by planning and adopting a routine. Start with what you can do within a day, give yourself little treats or rewards after accomplishing something on your plan.
- Journal or write down how you feel.
- Try to relive some of the World Cup moments with your friends and family, depending on what you can tolerate. This includes going through photos and videos you took and creating a memory board, compiled titktok, etc. This allows you to have closure.
- Listen to your body and mind. Do you need need physical rest? If you are tired and exhausted, it is important to be kind to yourself and take the time your need.

28,https://olympics.com/en/news/cristiano-ronaldo-number-jersey-squad-football,"Sir Alex Ferguson convinced Ronaldo to wear the No. 7 shirt after his move to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon.
Over the years, several greats; Eric Cantona, George Best and Garrincha to name a few; have graced the No. 7 jersey in football. While each left a mark, none are as synonymous with the iconic number as Cristiano Ronaldo.
Doting fans commonly refer to the Portuguese superstar as CR7, which today is nothing short of a global megabrand. Interestingly, Cristiano Ronaldo also owns the CR7 trademark and runs a luxury menswear brand under the banner.
But how did Cristiano become associated with the number 7? Here’s the full story.
Why is the number 7 jersey coveted
In many cultures around the world, the number seven is considered lucky. So, in many fronts of life, including sports, any involvement with the number is highly sought-after.
More often than not, the best or most talented players get their pick of jersey numbers, which has had a cascading effect on the myth of the No. 7 jersey in due time. Watching great players don the No. 7 on the field has only made the number more desirable for future generations.
Cristiano Ronaldo’s first jersey number was No. 28, given to him after he broke into the Sporting Lisbon first team from the youth setup in 2002.
In fact, it was in his jersey No. 28 that Ronaldo turned up for Sporting Lisbon in a pre-season friendly against Manchester United on August 6, 2003. The friendly match was organised to mark the opening of the Estadio Jose Alvalade - Sporting’s new and current home ground.
Ronaldo, at the time just 18, tormented the famous Manchester United defence in the match. Such was the youngster’s impact in the contest, that Man Utd players thronged Sir Alex Ferguson, the then United manager, and David Gill, then the chief executive, in the team bus and demanded that Cristiano Ronaldo be brought to Old Trafford.
A week later, Ronaldo was a Manchester United player.
As fate would have it, English superstar David Beckham, who used to occupy United’s No. 7 jersey before Ronaldo, had left the club for Real Madrid earlier in the same summer transfer window.
Manchester United’s iconic No. 7 jersey, worn over the years by club legends like Bryan Robson, George Best and Eric Cantona, was lying vacant and Sir Alex Ferguson deemed Ronaldo fit to take up the mantle.
Cristiano Ronaldo, still barely a teenager at the time, was initially unsure if he was ready to take up such a huge responsibility. Taking over the shirt from Beckham, a Manchester local boy and cult hero, was, after all, a monumental task.
But moved by Sir Alex’s confidence in him, Ronaldo accepted the iconic number. Ronaldo made his Manchester United debut wearing the No. 7 jersey number after coming on as a substitute against Bolton Wanderers in United’s 2003-04 Premier League season opener at Old Trafford. The rest, as they say, is history.
Over his next six seasons at Manchester, Cristiano Ronaldo made the No. 7 shirt his own, helping the Red Devils win the Premier League thrice and the UEFA Champions League once. He also won the Ballon d’Or, the first of his five, in 2008.
Temporary No. 9 jersey in Real Madrid
By the time Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid, his childhood dream club, in 2009, he was already one of the best players in the world.
Despite his reputation, though, Cristiano Ronaldo couldn’t retain the No. 7 jersey after his move to Real Madrid as at the time, it belonged to Raul Gonzalez, a true Madrid local boy and cult hero at the Santiago Bernabeu.
Raul, who was also lovingly called El Capitan for captaining both Real and the Spanish national team for years, however, would end up moving on from his boyhood club the next year, allowing Ronaldo to reclaim his beloved No. 7 jersey.
In his nine seasons with the Spanish giants, eight with the No. 7 on his back, Ronaldo would go on to score over 450 goals for Real Madrid, becoming the legendary club’s all-time top goal scorer. Incidentally, CR7 broke Raul’s record (323 goals) on his way to the top.
Ronaldo won two La Liga titles and a whopping four UEFA Champions League trophies with Real Madrid before moving to Serie A giants Juventus in 2018.
At the time of his move, Colombia’s Juan Cuadrado wore the No. 7 shirt for the Old Lady but this time, there was no making Ronaldo wait. Cuadrado promptly vacated the shirt for the Portuguese superstar.
Having moved back to Manchester United in 2021, Ronaldo, understandably, retained his No. 7 jersey.
Even before staking his claim on the No. 7 at Manchester United, Ronaldo did don the number briefly while representing the Portugal U-17 national team in 2001-02. He switched to No. 11 after his promotion to the U-21 national setup.
Ronaldo’s senior international debut came in August 2003 against Kazakhstan, coming on for Luis Figo as a half-time substitute. The then 18-year-old wore the No. 17 jersey at the time, with Figo, already a Portuguese legend, occupying the No. 7.
Cristiano Ronaldo first wore the No. 7 shirt for the senior Portugal football team while playing at the Athens 2004 Olympics but had to wait for a few more years, till Figo’s retirement in 2006, before staking claim on the Portugal No. 7 jersey full-time."

FIFA allotted $440 million in prize money for this World Cup, with teams receiving progressively larger sums according to how far they advanced in the competition.
The 2018 FIFA world cup champions France received $38 million in prize money four years ago, making this year's championship the greatest sum of money FIFA has ever awarded. The prize money given to the winning team increased from $8 million in 2002 to $20 million in 2006, a $4 million increase, not even the biggest so far. The World Cup winner today receives an overall sum that is more than five times greater than it was 2 Decades ago, thanks to increasing tournament revenue making sure that such gains have been allocated to winning teams.
The amount of prize money offered for the men's and women's World Cups continues to be drastically different. The overall prize money for the 2022 World Cup is $440 million, but the prize money for the 2023 Women's World Cup is only $60 million, a $380 million difference.

FIFA has doubled the prize money available for the forthcoming Women's World Cup, with only $30m allocated in 2019. However, there is still a sizable disparity.
All eyes will be on Sunday night's FIFA World Cup semi final between Argentina and France at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar. If France wins today's match, it will take home the World Cup for the second time, after defeating Croatia in 2018. However, a victory for Argentina would undoubtedly add a much-needed ruff to Messi's cap. Messi, who is currently regarded as the finest player in the world, will be hoisting the World Cup for the first time. It will also be Argentina's first championship since 1989.
FAQs:
- How many times did Argentina & France win the FIFA world cup title?
France and Argentina both have two FIFA World Cup victories. France won the championship in 1998 and 2018, while Argentina did it in 1978 and 1986.
- How much money will be given to the 3rd & 4th runner up team ?
Croatia, which finished third on the performance table, will receive $27 million. Morocco, who finished fourth, will receive $25 million in prize money.

31,https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/korean-footballer-cho-gue-sung-goes-viral-for-his-striking-good-looks-and-goals-8296322/,"The FIFA World Cup 2022 match between South Korea and Ghana on Monday prompted an unexpected surge in the popularity of South Korea’s Cho Gue-sung. Despite losing the match against Ghana by 3-2, the 24-year-old managed to steal the limelight, thanks to his striking looks and two goals that he managed to score within the first three minutes of the game. This made him the first-ever Asian player to score two headers in a single World Cup game.
Cho Gue-sung plays the forward position for the South Korean national team and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, a professional football club based in South Korea’s Jeonju. This is his first FIFA World Cup.
Cho Gue-sung has seen a multi-fold increase in his Instagram following after his match against Ghana on Monday. Many people who were unfamiliar with the Korean football team, began referring to Cho Gue-sung as ‘Player no 9’ based on his jersey number.
After the match, Korean journalist Hyunsu Yim Cho retweeted a fancam style video of Cho Gue-sung and predicted, “ Gue-sung about to see a crazy surge in followers on Insta”. It appears that this prediction was right as currently, Cho Gue Sung’s Instagram followers stand at 1.4 million, even though the star player has only 5 posts.

Ecuador
Jump to another team
This is Ecuador’s fourth World Cup and there are hopes they will equal their best performance, reaching the last 16. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Moisés Caicedo
Strengths
Ecuador have a very young team and with that comes speed, energy and adrenaline, with several new talents hoping to make their mark.
Weaknesses
Goalscoring. La Tricolor do not concede a lot but on the other hand they don’t find the net that often themselves either.
Netherlands
Jump to another team
The Dutch arrive in decent shape with Van Gaal set to become the most successful Oranje coach ever win-wise. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Virgil van Dijk
Strengths
The switch to 5-3-2 seems to have worked well, although some players were initially against it, and the form is good, as the Nations League showed.
Weaknesses
Creativity wise they are dependent on De Jong and Depay, both of whom who have suffered from injuries this season.
Qatar
Jump to another team
A historic first World Cup beckons for the hosts but they are in a tough group with Senegal, Netherlands and Ecuador. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Familiarity. Coach Sánchez has been in charge since 2017 and key members of the team have emerged together from the Aspire Academy.
Weaknesses
Physically this is a team that has been outmuscled on a number of occasions. How they cope off the ball will be crucial.
Senegal
Jump to another team
The reigning Afcon champions have great ambitions for the World Cup to end an already good year on a high. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Kalidou Koulibaly
Strengths
Cissé has created a hard-working team and maybe Dia can shoulder some of the responsibility up front with Mané injured.
Weaknesses
Quite a few players have struggled with injuries and/or being out of their club sides and arrive lacking playing time.
England
Jump to another team
Semi-finalists in 2018 – and Euro finalists three years later – Southgate’s side aim to go all the way – but have they peaked? Read the team guide here.
Strengths
In Kane England have one of the most lethal goalscorers around and he is backed up by creative, young talent such as Foden and Saka.
Weaknesses
Southgate has been criticised for being overly cautious and there are real concerns about the defence because of injuries and poor form.
Iran
Jump to another team
This will be Iran’s sixth World Cup and, boosted by a good performance in Russia, their aim is to get out of the group. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The reappointment of Carlos Queiroz means that Team Melli are very unlikely to concede any soft goals. He offers defensive stability.
Weaknesses
The handling of the former coach, Skocic, divided senior players and those feelings could resurface should Iran get off to a bad start.
United States
Jump to another team
USA are back at the World Cup after missing out on Russia but qualifying was anything but plain sailing. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Christian Pulisic
Strengths
Coach Berhalter has injected youth into the squad and the press can be effective, while there is creativity up front with Pulisic, Reyna and Aaronson.
Weaknesses
Centre-back and centre-forward positions are problematic and frequent injuries have prevented Berhalter from playing his best XI.
Wales
Jump to another team
Wales arrive for their first World Cup in 64 years free of expectation but are determined to do more than merely make up the numbers. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
A band of brothers spirit underpins a modest squad decorated with a pair of game-changers in Bale and Ramsey.
Weaknesses
If Joe Allen is not fit, they could lack nous in midfield. They also have only one bona fide No 9 in the squad in Moore
Argentina
Jump to another team
Argentina arrive in Qatar in unashamedly good shape having gone 35 games undefeated. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Scaloni has created a team and made Messi smile while playing for his country again. That may take them far.
Weaknesses
Losing Lo Celso to injury is a blow – he is an important player for Argentina – and Romero’s hamstring problems are a worry too.
Mexico
Jump to another team
El Tri have reached the Last 16 in every tournament since 1994 but that record feels under threat now. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Hirving Lozano
Strengths
Mexico should be able to cause opponents real problems on the wings with Vega and Lozano both dangerous and hard-working.
Weaknesses
Psychologically they seem to fall apart as soon as they concede and can be really inconsistent in games.
Poland
Jump to another team
Having qualified Poland have a new target: reaching the knockout round for the first time in 40 years. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Robert Lewandowski
Strengths
Firepower. In Lewandowski Poland have one of the best strikers in the world, with other players capable of scoring too.
Weaknesses
Defensive consistency. This has been lost since Euro 2016 and Poland can concede a lot of goals.
Saudi Arabia
Jump to another team
Renard’s new generation dominated Asian qualifying, but face a tough ask to repeat the achievements of 1994’s groundbreaking squad. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Salem Al-Dawsari
Strengths
They boast the Middle East’s finest player in Al Dawsari, plus a welcome blend of experience and youth. Conceded only 10 goals in 18 qualifiers.
Weaknesses
Goals have dried up and there is no clear favourite to start up top. Expected No 1 Al Owais is short of match practice.
Australia
Jump to another team
Australia have had their hopes of progression from a tough group further tempered by a spate of injuries. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The Socceroos are more than the sum of their parts and, cringeworthy as it may sound, have a collective mentality built to exceed expectations.
Weaknesses
A dearth of problem-solving skills against hard-to-break-down opposition is problematic, as is midfield possession and defensive mobility.
Denmark
Jump to another team
Having reached the semi-finals at the Euros and beaten France twice in the Nations League, Denmark arrive high on confidence. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Christian Eriksen
Strengths
Denmark are a well organised team, defending well as a unit and able to change formation and tactics during the game.
Weaknesses
Some of the forwards are out of form and goals could be a problem. A lot, as always, will depend on Eriksen.
France
Jump to another team
Fourth in the world rankings, this is a squad in flux, not unlike the one that showed promise in 2014. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
France’s attack is their strong point – they have shown themselves capable of scoring nearly at will with a full complement of players.
Weaknesses
Defence: injuries and a loss of form have decimated France’s back line. Pogba and Kanté will be missed in midfield too.
Tunisia
Jump to another team
Tunisia have lost only once since January but the 5-1 defeat against Brazil showed how far up it is to the top sides. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Youssef Msakni
Strengths
The midfield is the team’s strongest area with Ferencvaros’ Laïdouni capable of running the show against most opponents.
Weaknesses
Against better teams they struggle to create chances and are a bit too reliant on 32-year-old captain Msakni.
Costa Rica
Jump to another team
Coach Suárez only arrived in the middle of 2021 but has completely revamped the squad. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The youngsters, such as 18-year-old Bennette, has had a really positive impact while there is stability in defence.
Weaknesses
This Costa Rica team does not score a lot of goals (13 in 14 qualifiers) and at one point Suárez tested too many players.
Germany
Jump to another team
Germany may be one of the giants of world football but they are having a wobble. Semi-finals still a minimum requirement though. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
There are so many good creative midfielders that someone such as Gündogan may not start. Sané and Gnabry offer real threat from the flanks.
Weaknesses
The midfield is vulnerable defensively and there is no world-class central striker. Also, the quality of the full-backs are not at the highest level.
Japan
Jump to another team
Moriyasu has overhauled the squad and brought through a new generation with such little fuss that the public do not give him enough credit. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
With Tomiyasu and Yoshida at the back, plus Endo and Morita anchoring the midfield, this is arguably Japan’s strongest defensive foundation ever.
Weaknesses
Moriyasu gets criticised whomever he picks among the many attacking options but Japan do have an issue finding the right fit at No 9.
Spain
Jump to another team
‘We go for the win from the first minute,’ says Luis Enrique and Spain expect to go far as always. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Gavi and Pedro offer exuberance and energy in midfield and have a certain Busquets by their side to protect them (and the defence).
Weaknesses
Goals are not always that easy to come by and Morata was heavily criticised by fans at the Euros. He is still Spain’s focal point.
Belgium
Jump to another team
There is the sense that this generation of players have peaked and that the bronze from four years ago is as good as it will get. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Kevin De Bruyne
Strengths
There is an abundance of talent in the squad and any team with Courtois and De Bruyne will be expected to go deep into the tournament.
Weaknesses
The defence is ageing and slow and the main goal threat, Lukaku, has been struggling with injuries this season.
Canada
Jump to another team
Back on the biggest stage after a 36-year absence they were the best team in Concacaf qualifying, finishing above Mexico and USA. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Alphonso Davies
Strengths
Players such as Davies, David and Buchanan offer speed and explosiveness in transition. The team spirit is superb too.
Weaknesses
Canada lack experience at this level and do not have the star power in defence they have in other outfield areas.
Croatia
Jump to another team
Reached the final four years ago and have the potential to play even better this time. It is a new team but with the same midfield core. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The classy midfield can dictate games and the new defence looks good. Croatia have a remarkably deep and versatile squad.
Weaknesses
The goalkeepers are unreliable; the defenders inexperienced and there is no established goal-scoring presence up front.
Morocco
Jump to another team
A second consecutive Word Cup for the Atlas Lions, they qualified for Qatar without many of the mainstays from four years ago. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
There is stardust in Hakimi and Ziyech in a hard-working squad with Amrabat offering balance in midfield.
Weaknesses
Coach Regragui has been accused of playing defensive football in the past and has only been able to work with the squad for two and a half months.
Brazil
Jump to another team
One of the favourites, they are ranked the best team in the world and there seems to be harmony in the squad. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Brazil still have Neymar but are no longer Neymar-dependant with Vini Jnr, Richarlison and Raphinha taking some weight off the No 10’s shoulders.
Weaknesses
Tite has said he may play five attacking players, which would leave Casemiro vulnerable, and the defence is not the quickest.
Cameroon
Jump to another team
There is a lack of stars in Cameroon’s squad but that may not be a bad thing. Read the team guide here.
Star player
André-Frank Zambo Anguissa
Strengths
The squad has an impressive mental strength and the FA has worked hard to add players of dual nationality, such as Mbeumo.
Weaknesses
The coaching staff and players have only worked with each other for eight months and form has been patchy.
Serbia
Jump to another team
Every tournament is the same in Serbia: expectations that do not match the reality. However, there may be ground for optimism this time. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Dusan Vlahovic
Strengths
All the attacking players are on the rise and full of confidence. There are no egos and coach Stojkovic gives them freedom to play.
Weaknesses
The defence does not instil a lot of confidence in Serbian fans and one single mistake can lead to a full-blown collapse.
Switzerland
Jump to another team
Yakin has been able to build on Petkovic’s foundation and they stayed in the Nations League top group despite a poor start. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The generation that won the Under-17 World Cup in 2009 are in their peak years and players such as Akanji and Embolo are in fine form.
Weaknesses
Three of the four goalkeepers have had injury problems and the decision to take only two recognised full-backs could backfire.
Ghana
Jump to another team
This is a young Black Stars team in transition. The quality is there but this World Cup could be either a spectacular failure or a rip-roaring success. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Mohammed Kudus
Strengths
Ghana outsmarted Nigeria in the play-off and have added players of dual nationality since then, especially in defence and on the wings, and look better for it.
Weaknesses
Where will the goals come from? That is the main question for coach Addo. If that is answered, Ghana could go far in Qatar.
Portugal
Jump to another team
Cristiano Ronaldo’s power is on the wane and Fernando Santos has lost some of the credit gained in 2016 but Portugal have never had a stronger squad. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Cristiano Ronaldo
Strengths
Portugal have excellent goalkeepers, some of the best full-backs in the world and quality solutions all over midfield. Oh, and firepower up front.
Weaknesses
Santos does not have an abundance of centre-backs and up front Ronaldo’s struggles and Jota’s injury have cast a cloud over the preparations.
South Korea
Jump to another team
Things were looking good for manager Bento, until Son broke his eye socket. He could still play though. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Bento’s 4-1-4-1 system worked well in qualifying with a 2-0 win against Iran the highlight.
Weaknesses
Son’s injury the major concern but several key players, such as the two Hwangs and Kwon, have been out of form.
Uruguay
Jump to another team
Uruguay are an unknown quantity but Diego Alonso has a good mix of youth and experience in the squad. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Federico Valverde
Strengths
Alonso has one of the best midfields at the tournament, led by Valverde, while Núñez, Suárez and Cavani are a threat up front.
Weaknesses
There are huge question marks about the defence with the fitness of Godín, Giménez and Araujo uncertain."

Two second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe, despite a goal from Denmark’s Andreas Christensen, confirmed its route for the pre-quarterfinals of Qatar 2022.
The first goal came just after the hour-mark, when a pass from Theo Hernandez was carried into the box by Mbappe, who finished with ease past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. But the defining moment of the match came in the 86th minute when Antoine Griezmann’s cross was slotted in by the 23-year-old for his second of the night.
With the goal, the Paris Saint-Germain striker became the joint-highest goalscorer in the FIFA World Cup and also the second-highest goal scorer for France in the World Cups, tied with Zinedine Zidane (both seven goals) and just behind Just Fontaine (13 goals).
The win breaks the ‘champion’s curse’ for the Les Blues, who suffered the wrath of the curse 20 years ago, when it was eliminated in the group stage, after winning the World Cup in 1998.
What is the champion’s curse?
Since 1998, European countries winning the FIFA World Cup have failed to make it through beyond the group stages, starting with France, 14 years ago.
Italy, the FIFA World Cup 2006 winner was knocked out in the 2010 edition of the tournament, while Spain, winning its maiden World Cup in 2010, was eliminated four years later as well.

Germany followed suit with a shock exit in Russia four years ago, after beating Argentina in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. Two late goals by Son Heung-min and Kim Young-gwon stunned the defending World Champion as it retuned empty-handed.
Why is it called the France curse in the World Cup?
It is called the France curse in the World Cup because it started with Les Blues in 1998.
Hence, it was poetic justice for France to break the curse, with Didier Deschamps in charge of the side - a man, who was a member of the squad who was first subject to the curse 14 years ago.
No World Cup champion has been able to defend the coveted World crown since Brazil in 1962. With France looking a dangerous side, with six goals in two matches so far, it will be hopeful to script history in Qatar this time around"
34,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/qatar-heads-for-epic-comedown-after-argentina-v-france-world-cup-final,"Bloomberg UK A weekly deep dive into the biggest economic, financial and political issues facing the UK. The show goes beyond the market moves, with expert analysis and top interviews from the heart of London."
35,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/france-names-25-man-squad-for-fifa-world-cup-varane-kimpembe-and-giroud-picked/article66118883.ece,"France coach Didier Deschamps picked central defenders Raphael Varane and Prensel Kimpembe, but left out standout goalkeeper Mike Maignan in a World Cup squad announced Wednesday amid injury concerns.
Deschamps announced his 25-man squad on national television. Defending champion France opens against Australia on November 22, and the squad flies to Qatar next Wednesday.
“We have a huge challenge ahead of us. Nothing is bigger than the World Cup. But I have total faith in my players,” Deschamps said. “You can’t change the physical form players are in. We play on the 22nd, so at least we have one week to prepare.”
Veteran striker Olivier Giroud was selected after some fine performances for AC Milan this season. The 36-year-old striker needs three goals to beat Thierry Henry's national team record of 51.
“I think it’s better for the France team that he’s with us,"" said Deschamps, adding that Giroud remains second choice behind Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema. “He knows his status.”
But Maignan — Giroud's club teammate and the best goalkeeper in Serie A when Milan won the league last season — was left out as he recovers from an ongoing calf injury. The 37-year-old Steve Mandanda takes his place as backup for No. 1 Hugo Lloris.
Varane selected despite hamstring injury
Varane, who has 87 international caps, has not played since sustaining a hamstring injury with Manchester United on October 11. He was a rock in France's defence when it won the 2018 World Cup.
Kimpembe, a PSG defender who has 28 caps, has been hampered by a six-week hamstring injury and a recent Achilles Tendon problem.
“Presnel will be ready (for PSG) on Sunday,” Deschamps said. “Raphael’s injury was a bit longer, but he could also be ready against Australia.”
William Saliba, who has excelled for Premier League leader Arsenal this season, and Bayern Munich's Dayot Upamecano provide good cover in central defense.
Marseille right back Jonathan Clauss was left out but teammate Jordan Veretout got the nod in a midfield lineup that includes Real Madrid pair Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni.
“I saw quite a few World Cups in front of the TV with my family,"" the 22-year-old Tchouameni said. ""So hearing my name in the list bings back memories, and now I’m part of it.""
Additional players allowed
FIFA let teams add three players to the usual squads of 23 because of disruption to football during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some players have looked tense in recent weeks amid the fear of getting injured close to the tournament.
“It hasn’t been the easiest choice. But my fellow coaches have faced the same problems during this period,” Deschamps said. “Players have been getting injured and may still get injured.”
Kante, Pogba unavailable
France is without Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante because of injuries, depriving Deschamps of his two best midfielders from the 2018 World Cup.
The 34-year-old Benzema, who has been dealing with muscle fatigue and a bothersome thigh, will miss his sixth straight start when Madrid hosts Cádiz in the Spanish league on Thursday.
Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said Benzema was not trying to preserve himself for France. Deschamps said he's overplayed.
“He’s played an enormous amount, maybe too much at one point. Karim knows that the World Cup is very important for him,"" Deschamps said. ""He hasn’t refused to play for Real Madrid, he just wasn’t in top form. He'll do everything to be ready for the 22nd.”
Strong attack
Deschamps has an attack packed with pace, skill and power.
PSG star Kylian Mbappe joins Benzema, along with Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Ousmane Dembele (Barcelona), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) and Christopher Nkunku, who is enjoying another fine season with Leipzig.
France lost to Switzerland in the round of 16 at the European Championship last year but bounced back to win the Nations League a few months later.
But Deschamps thinks injury concerns could sharpen the focus.
“French teams are not at their best when they’re in a comfort zone,” he said. “We can’t say that we’re in one now.”
France plays Australia at Al Janoub Stadium, then faces Denmark at Stadium 974 before completing its Group D matches against Tunisia on Nov. 30 at Education City Stadium.
No team has successfully defended its World Cup title since Brazil in 1962.
“You’re not going to sap my morale,"" Deschamps told the television presenter when reminded. ""Reaching the highest level is a difficult thing, staying there is even more difficult.”
France’s 25-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar
Goalkeepers: Alphone Areola (West Ham), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Steve Mandanda (Rennes).

36,https://www.sportingnews.com/in/soccer/news/fifa-rankings-world-cup-teams-updated-calculated/mxphm9f5h9j81ti9rkhvnqhc,"FIFA rankings are a unique way to measure how national teams compare to each other and can prove important when it comes to tournaments like a World Cup.
Draws for such events are influenced by rankings, with the best teams separated from facing each other in the group stages.
This means nations with lower rankings are often drawn in tougher groups and have an even tougher task to win the overall tournament.
FIFA rankings aren't perfect and have come in for criticism in recent years, but they do provide a solid and reliable overview of a side's general consistency and how they'll likely fair come World Cup time.

FIFA rankings for all 32 World Cup teams
Brazil entered the 2022 World Cup as the world No.1 and have held top spot since March 31 this year when they replaced Belgium, who themselves were top for nearly four years.
Ghana, meanwhile, arrived in Qatar as the lowest-ranked nation with the African side currently 61st.
Italy (6th) are the highest ranked side not to have qualified, and Saudi Arabia, in 51st, caused a sensational upset by beating third-ranked Argentina in their opening game.

Which teams have been world number one?
Only eight nations to date have been crowned world number one.
Germany were top when rankings were first introduced with Brazil eventually replacing them.
From there, Italy, France, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, and Belgium have all also enjoyed stints as world number one.
France and Belgium became the first nations to share top spot when they did so briefly in late 2018.
Does the top-ranked side win the World Cup?
Surprisingly, the team ranked number one going into the World Cup has never won the tournament.
Rankings have only been active since the 1994 World Cup, where Germany went in as leaders only to be replaced by eventual winners Brazil.
In 1998, Brazil were still number one but were beaten 3-0 by France in that year's World Cup final.
France were then top during the 2002 World Cup only for Brazil to bounce back and lift the title.
Brazil were world number one going into the 2006 and 2010 tournaments but Italy and Spain both triumphed on those occasions.
Spain were then top going into 2014 when Germany triumphed, who themselves were number one in 2018 when France took out the title.
This trend has continued in 2022 with Brazil knocked out in the quarterfinals and now likely to lose their number one ranking.
How are FIFA rankings calculated?
FIFA rankings have existed since 1992 and uses a points-scoring system to work out standings.
The method for calculating FIFA rankings was officially changed in August 2018.
This new system works by adding or subtracting points from a team's previous total based on results rather than using an average number of points earned over a certain period.
The number of points added or subtracted is influenced by the calibre of opponent a team faces. For example, beating a team ranked inside the top 10 will result in more points being gained than defeating a side ranked outside the top 20. The expected result of the game will also impact the number of points gained.
Specific games are given more weight too, so winning a World Cup match will result in more points than claiming victory in an international friendly.
Matches decided by penalty shootouts are a factor as well with losing teams given the same points as for a draw, while winners only get points equivalent to half a win.
Losing knockout round matches of final competitions also won't result in teams losing any points.
Here's a calculation example provided by FIFA:
- Team A has 1300 points before the match and wins a continental qualifier against team B that has 1500 points
- For team A the formula is: P=1300+25*(1–(1/(10 exp (-(1300–1500)/600) +1)))
- For team B the formula is: P = 1500 + 25 * (0- (1 / (10 exp (-(1500-1300)/600) + 1)))
- Thus, team A wins 17 points and has P = 1317 points after the match
- Team B loses the same amount of points and thus ends up with 1483 points after the match
FIFA rankings points system
If the above example has you scratching your head, you're not alone. But understanding the points system a bit better should help with that.
The 'importance co-efficient' plays a big part in determining just how many ranking points a team can earn from each fixture and is as follows:
- 5 – friendlies played outside the International Match Calendar windows
- 10 – friendlies played within the International Match Calendar windows
- 15 – UEFA Nations League matches (group stage)
- 25 – UEFA Nations League matches (playoffs and finals), Confederations' final competitions qualifiers, FIFA World Cup qualifiers
- 35 – Confederations' final competitions matches (before quarter-finals)
- 40 – Confederations' final competitions matches (quarter-finals and later)
- 50 – FIFA World Cup matches (before quarter-finals)
- 60 – FIFA World Cup matches (quarter-finals, semi-finals, third place play-off and final)
The result of said match then combines with the expected result to determine what percentage of the above points are awarded.
When are FIFA rankings updated?
FIFA rankings are updated after each recognised international window.
As such, they are generally revised several times a year depending on the FIFA calendar.
This year, rankings will only be updated a total of six times with the final revision of 2022 to be made on December 22 after the World Cup in Qatar has concluded."

LUSAIL, Qatar -- Cameroon's Vincent Aboubakar scored a late winner to hand them a memorable 1-0 win over Brazil on Friday, but it was not enough to see Rigobert Song's side through to the knockout stages of Qatar 2022.
- World Cup 2022: News and features | Schedule | Squads
Brazil dominated much of the match, but Aboubakar's 90th-minute winner ensured Cameroon's World Cup campaign finished on a winning note. He celebrated by taking his shirt off and was subsequently sent off by referee Ismail Elfath, who handed the striker a second yellow card for his celebration following another booking earlier in the match.
With qualification already secured, Brazil manager Tite made nine changes to his side ahead of the match and handed Dani Alves the captaincy, and while they head through as winners of Group G, this was a shock result and not the preparation they wanted ahead of their round-of-16 matchup against South Korea on Monday.

Rapid reaction
1. Cameroon give this World Cup another shock
Tite's much-changed Brazil side gave the fresh starters a wonderful opportunity to give the manager a selection headache ahead of the round of 16. A couple took it, while others let it pass them by.
Regardless of the changes, Brazil's expectations remain the same: they anticipated and demanded a win. In a World Cup of shocks, this was another to add to the list.
The swathes of changes represented Tite reinforcing the faith he has in the whole squad to get the job done here in Qatar. Only third-choice keeper Weverson is yet to get any minutes. But the selection gamble, in the short term at least, didn't pay off.
Of those brought in, it was the Arsenal man Gabriel Martinelli who was Brazil's best player on the field as his trickery caused Cameroon a headache. Twice he managed to slip past his marker to get shots on goal, and it was only the astute positioning of goalkeeper Devis Epassy that kept them out.
There were those who failed to make the most of their opportunity, though. Gabriel Jesus never really managed to fashion a chance -- replaced after 54 minutes by Everton Ribeiro -- but did well in link-up play. On the opposite flank to Martinelli, Antony showed flashes of brilliance in the opening stages but was eventually marked out of the game by the Seattle Sounders' Tolo Nouhou. Rodrygo was one of the more promising players off the bench in Brazil's 1-0 win over Switzerland but was handed some rough justice by the Cameroon defence and didn't manage to trouble the goal.
Their profligacy ended up costing them, while it was a defensive lapse that allowed Aboubakar to head home unmarked late on with Bremer missing his man. That will give Tite cause for concern with South Korea lying in wait and the injured personnel watching on from the stands.
For Brazil, the focus was on those in the stands or unused on the bench as much as on those on the field. Neymar was present in the stadium as he continues recovery from an ankle injury -- the sight of him drew huge cheers from the Brazil fans who packed Lusail Stadium -- while Danilo and Alex Sandro were also there. Given that Alex Telles was forced off injured in the early stages of the second half, Brazil will be hoping Alex Sandro is available for the next phase. The signs are promising there, but the breadth of the squad's reserves in defence was tested here with Marquinhos ending up as a makeshift left-back.
For those who wanted to force their way into the starting lineup, the majority failed to take their chance.
2. Cameroon impress despite group stage exit
Cameroon needed a victory against Brazil and results elsewhere to go their way if they were to progress to the knockout rounds, but despite getting the job done their turbulent World Cup ends at the group stage. Considering they started with a lacklustre 1-0 defeat to Switzerland, then had to cope with the scandal surrounding goalkeeper Andre Onana's departure, the fact that they rallied and were still in with a shout of making the round of 16 heading into the final game was credit to them.
Their heroics against Serbia -- when they came back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 -- gave them the platform to create history against Brazil. They were patient. For so much of the match they had their backs against the wall. Up until Aboubakar's late winner, the closest they came was Bryan Mbeumo's header on the stroke of half-time, which needed a world-class save from Ederson to be kept out.
The script was similar in the second half, as they repelled anything and everything Brazil threw at them. And credit has to go the players and manager for their defensive organisation. Given they were without their two first-choice centre-backs for the game -- both Jean-Charles Castelletto and Nicolas Nkoulou were injured -- the fact they managed to keep out Brazil was a great effort. And in the absence of Onana, Epassy put in a monumental performance in goal. He was sensational in keeping out the Brazilian waves of attack. It all gave Aboubakar his shot at history.
3. Dani Alves makes Brazilian men's World Cup history
The ageless Dani Alves cemented his place in Brazilian football history as he became the oldest men's player to represent his country in a World Cup. He captained the side, and aged 39 years and 210 days, he overtook the previous record held by fellow right-back Djalma Santos, who was 37 back at the 1966 World Cup.
Alves' inclusion in the 26-man squad was questioned. Tite came in for heavy criticism for picking the veteran, given Alves was struggling with a knee injury and is in the twilight of his career. But the manager -- in his own, soft-spoken way -- backed the former Barcelona stalwart, saying full-backs in his system don't necessarily need grass-scorching speed, and the 39-year-old had other qualities that would be invaluable.
The man himself said prematch that he would be happy just playing the tambourine to maintain morale, but he proved against Cameroon that he isn't here merely to make up the numbers. He did well keeping threats from his flank at bay for so much of the match, and given Brazil's injuries at full-back will likely be called upon at some stage against South Korea in the round of 16.

Best and worst performers
BEST: Devis Epassy, Cameroon. The Abha No. 1 was monumental in goal for Cameroon. He stopped anything and everything thrown his way.
WORST: Gabriel Jesus, Brazil. Tricky, this one, but the Arsenal forward failed to put his stamp on the game.
Highlights and notable moments
With Brazil legend Pele in hospital suffering from a respiratory infection, Selecao fans sent the former Santos star their best.
Even Ismail Elfath felt bad having to send off Aboubakar.
After the match: What the players and managers said
Epassy: ""We can be proud of what we did tonight as it showed we can be a top team. We didn't qualify, though, which is why we're not overly happy with tonight.""
Fabinho: ""If you don't kill [the game], the opponent only needs one chance. This is what happened. Thankfully, we finished top of the group. It was not a loss that eliminated us but we can still learn from it. We created a lot but we can't miss so many goals.""
Key stats (provided by ESPN Stats & Information)
- Mbeumo's shot on goal in the third minute of first-half stoppage time was the first shot on goal Brazil have faced this World Cup.
- Aboubakar is the first player to be sent off from a game for excessive celebration in a World Cup match going back to at least 1966.
- Cameroon ended Brazil's World Cup group stage unbeaten streak at 17 games. Prior to Friday, they hadn't lost in this phase of the competition since 1998 when Norway defeated them.

The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. A hat-trick occurs when a player scores three or more goals in a single match and it is considered an achievement, especially while playing at the largest international football tournament in the world. Across the over 800 matches at the 22 tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, 54 hat-tricks have been scored. The first hat-trick was scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States, playing against Paraguay in 1930; the most recent was by Kylian Mbappé of France, playing against Argentina on 18 December 2022. The only World Cup not to have at least one hat-trick scored was the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The record number of hat-tricks in a single World Cup tournament is eight, during the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland.
19 players have scored a hat-trick in the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. Two were playing in their first ever World Cup match, Edmund Conen and Angelo Schiavio, both in 1934, a tournament without a group stage. Geoff Hurst (1966) & Kylian Mbappé (2022) are the only players to have scored a hat-trick in the final. Two players have scored a hat-trick in the second group stage of the World Cup, Paolo Rossi and Zbigniew Boniek, both in 1982.

Notable World Cup hat-tricks[edit]
- This section features records and notable hat-tricks relating to the men's World Cup. For notable hat-tricks at the Women's World Cup, see List of FIFA Women's World Cup hat-tricks#Notable World Cup hat-tricks.
- Bert Patenaude was the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, on 17 July 1930 against Paraguay. However, until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude. In 2006, FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as teammate Tom Florie's goal in the match against Paraguay was re-attributed to him.[1]
- Four players have scored two hat-tricks in World Cup matches: Sándor Kocsis (both 1954); Just Fontaine (both 1958); Gerd Müller (both 1970); and Gabriel Batistuta (1994 and 1998).[2] Batistuta is thus the only person to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record of scoring hat-tricks, both were achieved on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty.[3] Kocsis and Müller scored their hat-tricks in consecutive matches.
- Oleg Salenko is the only player in World Cup history to have scored five goals in a single match. He did this during the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Russia and Cameroon.[4]
- One player has scored a hat-trick on his international début: Guillermo Stábile (1930).[5]
- One player has scored four goals for the losing side: Ernst Wilimowski (5–6, 1938).[6]
- Three other players have scored a hat-trick for the losing side: Josef Hügi (5–7, 1954), Kylian Mbappe (3–3, losing 4–2 on penalties, 2022), and Igor Belanov (3–4, 1986).
- One other player has scored a hat-trick in a game that his side did not win: Cristiano Ronaldo (3–3, 2018)[7]
- There have been three occasions when two hat-tricks have been scored in the same match. Two occurred during the 1938 FIFA World Cup: when Sweden defeated Cuba, Gustav Wetterström and Harry Andersson, both playing for Sweden, scored three goals, with the former completing his in the first half. In the Brazil vs Poland, Leônidas did it for Brazil and Ernst Wilimowski for Poland. One occurred in 1954: when Austria defeated Switzerland, Theodor Wagner and Josef Hügi scored hat-tricks for Austria and Switzerland respectively.
- Two players have scored hat-tricks in World Cup Finals. Geoff Hurst scored three goals for England against West Germany in the 1966 Final.[2][8] This is also the longest hat-trick to be completed — most time between the first and third goals. His first goal came at 18', while the second and third goals were in extra time at 98' and 120'. Kylian Mbappé scored the other World Cup finals' hat-trick in the 2022 FIFA World Cup final for France against Argentina. His goals were scored at the 80th, 81st and 118th minute marks. Two of his goals - 80th and 118th - were successful penalty kicks.
- The quickest hat-trick by a player is Erich Probst, who scored at 4', 21', and 24' in 1954, playing for Austria against Czechoslovakia in the first round.
- The briefest hat-trick to be completed — that is, the shortest time between the first and third goals — is the one by László Kiss in 1982 against El Salvador. He scored at 69', 72', and 76', making the time between his first and third 7 minutes. This is also the only hat-trick scored by a substitute.
- The only players to have scored from three headers in a single match are Tomáš Skuhravý in 1990 and Miroslav Klose in 2002.[2]
- The youngest player to score a hat-trick is Pelé, at 17 years, 244 days.
- The oldest player to score a hat-trick is Cristiano Ronaldo, at 33 years, 130 days.[9]
- Germany (incl. West Germany) holds the record for most hat-tricks scored with 7. Germany also shares with South Korea the record for most hat-tricks conceded with 4.

41,https://olympics.com/en/news/oldest-goal-scorer-fifa-world-cup-football,"Roger Milla holds the record of being the oldest footballer to score a goal in the FIFA World Cup, having scored at the age of 42 years and 39 days. Know the full list.
Football, especially at the highest levels like the FIFA World Cup, is a young man’s game.
Outfield players in football peak in their late 20s or early 30s. By the time they are in their mid-30s, most are past their prime and consequently, players over 35 are often a rarity on the biggest stage of the game
However, there are an exceptional few, who have defied age and made their mark on the biggest of stages even in their twilight years. Cameroon legend Roger Milla, the oldest goal-scorer in a FIFA World Cup match, and Portugal ace Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently became the third-oldest footballer to score in a World Cup match, are fine examples.
Here are the 10 oldest World Cup goal-scorers in the history of football.
|No.||Player (Country)||Age||Opponent||Edition|
|1||Roger Milla (Cameroon)||42 years, 39 days||Russia||USA 1994|
|2||Pepe (Portugal)||39 years, 283 days||Switzerland||Qatar 2022|
|3||Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)||37 years, 295 days||Ghana||Qatar 2022|
|4||Gunnar Gren (Sweden)||37 years, 236 day||West Germany||Sweden 1958|
|5||Cuauhtemoc Blanco (Mexico)||37 years, 151 days||France||South Africa 2010|
|6||Felipe Baloy (Panama)||37 years, 120 days||England||Russia 2018|
|7||Obdulio Varela (Uruguay)||36 years, 279 days||England||Switzerland 1954|
|8||Martin Palermo (Argentina)||36 years, 227 days||Greece||South Africa 2010|

|10||Tom Finney (England)||36 years, 64 days||Soviet Union||Sweden 1958|
Cameroon legend Roger Milla holds the record of being the oldest footballer to score a goal in the men’s FIFA World Cup, having netted against Russia in the 1994 World Cup in the USA at the ripe old age of 42 years and 39 days.
To date, Roger Milla, often dubbed ‘the Old Lion’ by fans, is the only player over 40 years of age to have scored at a World Cup. However, perhaps the story that led up to Milla’s feat is even more fascinating than the record in itself.
Having made his international debut in 1973, Roger Milla retired from international football in 1987 at the age of 35. For 15 years, the striker had enjoyed a fruitful career with the national side and hung up his boots with the reputation as one of the best footballers to have ever come out of Cameroon and Africa.
An Olympian from the Los Angeles 1984 Games, Roger Milla had also represented Cameroon at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain and even got the ball in the net in a match against Peru. Unfortunately, the goal was disallowed and Milla had made peace with the fact that his dream of scoring in a World Cup will remain unrealised.
However, little did Milla know when he retired that his best years were yet to come. The striker was still playing club football after his early international retirement. However, after Cameroon qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, fate came calling.
Paul Biya, the then President of Cameroon, had seen Milla play in a charity match and insisted that he be included in the national team for the showpiece in Italy. Biya went a step further and personally called Roger Milla to make up his mind.
“I got a call from the President who said he thought I should play and I was in no position to argue. I knew that if I got into shape, I could make an impact.” Milla later told Reuters.
Roger Milla scored four goals, all after coming on as a substitute, to lead Cameroon to the quarter-finals of Italy 1990 - the furthest any African team had progressed in the competition at that time. Senegal matched the record in 2002.
Milla didn’t score in his nine-minute cameo against reigning champions Argentina, a match Cameroon famously won with nine men. But Milla scored twice against Romania in a group game before single-handedly dragging the Indomitable Lions to the quarters with a brace against Colombia in the Round of 16.
Incidentally, any of Milla’s goals in the 1990 World Cup would have been enough to make him the oldest-ever scorer in FIFA World Cup history. His extra-time brace against Colombia in the pre-quarterfinals came when he was 38 years and 34 days old - a good 100 days younger than Cristiano Ronaldo, the second-oldest World Cup scorer in history.
However, Roger Milla would return for the 1994 World Cup in the USA and scored Cameroon’s only goal in a 6-1 defeat to Russia. However, his feat in the contest was overshadowed by Oleg Salenko’s five goals, which still stands as the record for most goals scored in a single World Cup match by a player.
Roger Milla is also the oldest outfield player and third-oldest player to have ever taken the field in a football World Cup match. Egypt’s Essam El-Hadary (45 years, 161 days) and Colombia’s Faryd Mondragon (43 years, 3 days), the top two oldest players to have played in a World Cup match, were both goalkeepers.
Pepe became the oldest player to score at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar when he netted one in Portugal’s 6-1 drubbing of Switzerland in the Round of 16. At 39 years and 283 days, Pepe thus became the second-oldest ever to score at the World Cup, eclipsing Cristiano Ronaldo, who had taken the position in the team’s opening game.
Captaining the team against Switzerland, Pepe was the second player to score in the match, handing Portugal a 2-0 lead in the 33rd minute. In the end, however, it was Gonçalo Ramos who starred for Portugal with a hat-trick, the first of Qatar 2022.
Cristiano Ronaldo became the third-oldest World Cup goal-scorer in history after converting from the penalty spot during Portugal’s 3-2 win over Ghana in their Group H opener at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
The Portuguese legend’s penalty kick in the 65th minute was the opening goal of the match and proved vital as the match ended 3-2 in Portugal’s favour.
Incidentally, Russian defender Sergei Ignashevich did score an own goal against Spain in the 2018 World Cup in South Africa at the age of 38 years and 352 days. However, self goals aren’t counted as records.
Before Roger Milla came out of retirement and scored his maiden World Cup goal against Romania in Italy 1990, Sweden’s Gunnar Gren owned the record of the oldest goal-scorer in a football World Cup for over three decades.
Gunnar Gren’s only World Cup goal came against West Germany in the semi-finals, a match Sweden famously won before going down 5-2 to Pele’s Brazil in the final.
Gunnar Gren’s Swedish team-mate Nils Liedholm netted the opening goal in the 1958 final against Brazil, which made him the oldest player to score in a World Cup final. Nils Liedholm was 35 years and 264 days old at the time.
Considered one of the greats of Swedish football, Gunnar Gren played a pivotal role in helping his national team win the gold medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.
Obdulio Varela, who captained Uruguay to the FIFA World Cup title in 1950, and Germany’s Miroslav Klose, the top goal-scorer in World Cup history also features in the top 10 list of oldest scorers in the football World Cup.
Formiga (Brazil) 37 years and 98 days vs South Korea in FIFA Women’s World Cup 2015
Brazil’s Formiga is the oldest goal-scorer in the FIFA Women’s World Cup, having scored in a match against South Korea in her team’s Group E opener vs South Africa in the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2015 in Canada. She was 37 years and 98 days old at the time.
USA legend Megan Rapinoe is the oldest player to have scored in a FIFA Women’s World Cup final. She scored in the 2019 Women’s World Cup final against the Netherlands just two days after her 34th birthday."

Japan shocked all in beating Germany and Spain to reach the last-16 of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - and the stats have laid bare the remarkable nature of their achievement.
Hajime Moriyasu's side upset the odds in beating the two football giants - with five World Cups between them - to finish top of Group E and set up a seemingly winnable last-16 tie with Croatia.
Key to their success was their ability to sit deep, made viable by their impressive backline, and hit the over-exposed sides on the break.
Japan were forced - as they did against Germany - to sit in for large periods and contain
Spain enjoyed lots of the ball and could have wrapped the game up by the break but Japan rode their luck and emerged victorious
Indeed, such was the players' ability to carry out their coach's instructions, Japan broke the record for the lowest amount of possession held by a winning team in any World Cup fixture since 1966.
Their 18 per cent possession of Spain outstripped South Korea's 26 per cent against Germany in 2018 and their own 27 per cent against the same opposition in their Group E opener.
Forced to sit back and contain Spain for much of the first half, Japan trailed at the break thanks to a header from Alvaro Morata, notching his third goal in three games - seemingly ensuring his side finished top of the group.

The Japan players fell to the ground and celebrated wildly after they beat Spain to finish top of Group E
However, coming out for the second half, Moriyasu made his - now - customary changes and Japan emerged out of their shell to leave Spain's players dumbfounded and fearful of their place in the next round.
Ritsu Doan, introduced at half-time alongside Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, got Japan level just after the break with a lashed left-footed effort that was too powerful for Unai Simon in the Spain goal.
With their tails up and knowing Germany were likely to defeat Costa Rica, Japan pressed for another, three minutes after their equaliser they had it through Ao Tanaka . The controversy surrounding their second - was the ball over the line or wasn't it - took away from the astonishing nature of their achievement.
Their policy of containment allowed them to hit an over-exposed Spain side on the break
Needing to protect their lead, Japan retreated back into their customary low block with Shogo Taniguchi, Maya Yoshida and Kou Itakura being joined by Arsenal's Takehiro Tomiyasu to form a solid base which Spain, for all their possession, could not penetrate.
Japan's 27 per cent of the ball against Germany had seemed impressive, but sinking to 18 per cent has left many wondering how low can Japan go with their low block in attempting to keep their opponents at bay.
Spain, meanwhile, were on the receiving end of another shock result that stemmed from a team in essence refusing to hold onto the ball when Switzerland beat them 1-0 at the start of the 2010 World Cup. Ottmar Hitzfeld's side enjoyed just 27.12 per cent of the ball that day.
Saudi Arabia's famous victory over Argentina in Qatar last month completes the five lowest totals, with Herve Renard's side recording just 31 per cent possession.

The event started with American actor Morgan Freeman's dulcet voice and an Arabian theme with camels.
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani arrived at the stadium flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino to a roaring crowd. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was also present at the opening ceremony and inaugural match of the tournament.
The opening show also saw the performance of a new tournament song called ‘Dreamers’ featuring singer Jungkook of K-pop boy band BTS, alongside Qatari singer Fahad Al-Kubaisi. Interestingly, Qatar is also the smallest nation to host soccer's biggest global event. Crowd control will be key with some 1.2 million visitors expected - more than a third of its population.
A ban on sale of beer was imposed two days before the opening ceremony of the World Cup.However, at the FIFA Fan Festival in central Doha, visitors were seen sipping beers. But the conditions outside the city's edges were different as hundreds of workers gathered in a sports arena in an industrial zone, without alcohol.
Thousands of attendees were turned away from a Saturday night concert in the official fan zone because of overcrowding. According to the reports, around 1.2 million visitors are expected to begin arriving this week in the tiny nation on the Arabian Peninsula.
Qatar - which is home to 3 million people, mostly migrant workers - has spent more than $200 billion on improvements across the country for the tournament. Among the additions are seven new purpose-built venues, including the 60,000-seat Al Bayt Stadium that hosted Sunday's opening ceremony and the first match.

Zinedine Zidane in his prime was just pure art. Michel Platini was very much a player in the same mould. Just Fontaine is an absolute World Cup legend.
And then there were clinical attackers such as Jean-Pierre Papin, David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry.
These days, the likes of Karim Benzema, Olivier Giroud, and Kylian Mbappe have taken over the mantle and spend a lot of their time on the pitch celebrating goals.
Giroud has latestly surpassed Thierry Henry as France's all-time leading men's scorer by scoring for Les Bleus in the 2022 FIFA World Cup round of 16 match against Poland.
But who is France's most lethal attacker ever?
Let's take a look at the legends leading their all-time goalscoring charts!"

- Missed all three against Morocco
- Lost shootout and exit World Cup
WHAT HAPPENED? Spain have been knocked out of the World Cup by Morocco on penalties. The two teams played out a goalless draw which meant spot-kicks were needed to determine the winner. Luis Enrique admitted before the game his side had done plenty of practice, but he could only sit and watch as Carlos Soler, Pablo Sarabia and Sergio Busquets missed all three Spain penalties.
WHAT THEY SAID: ""I imagine that they have done their homework. Over a year ago, in one of the Spain camps, I told them they had to get here with at least 1,000 penalties taken. If you wait until getting here to practise penalties... [it won't be enough],"" he told reporters.
""It's a moment of maximum tension, a time to show your nerve and that you can shoot the penalty in the way you have decided, if you have trained it a thousand times. It says a lot about each player. It's trainable, manageable, how you manage the tension. It's increasingly less luck - the goalkeepers have more influence. We have a very good goalkeeper, any of the three can do very well in this situation. Every time we finish training, I see a lot of players taking penalties.""
THE BIGGER PICTURE: Spain may have done their homework regarding penalties but it certainly didn't pay off in Qatar. Sarabia hit the post with Spain's first spot-kick, while Soler and Busquets were both denied by goalkeeper Yassine Bounou who was the hero for Morocco. Achraf Hakimi then showed Spain exactly how it's done by sealing the win with a cheeky panenka.
IN THREE PHOTOS:GettyGettyGetty
DID YOU KNOW? Spain have become the first nation in World Cup history to lose four penalty shootouts, while they've become just the second side to not score in one after Switzerland against Ukraine in 2006.
WHAT NEXT? Luis Enrique's side will now home after being knocked out of the World Cup. Morocco go on to play either Portugal or Switzerland in the quarter-finals."

Eponyms and public art
Family
Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América, the 2022 Finalissima, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (102). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).
Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.
An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, became the first player to score in every stage of a World Cup (including two in the final), and broke the record for most appearances in World Cup tournaments with 26 matches played.
Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team-sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.
Early life
Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[9] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[4] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, ""Leo"" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[10] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[11] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[12][13]
""When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.""
– Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[14]
A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of ""The Machine of '87"", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[15][16] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[17] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[18][19] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him ""the best forward I've ever seen"".[20]
As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[18][21] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[15][21][22]
After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[23] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[24] Messi became an integral part of the ""Baby Dream Team"", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[23][25] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[26] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[21][27][28]

– Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[29]
During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[30] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[31][32] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: ""He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.""[33]
At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[21][34] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[35] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[36] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called ""little brother"", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[37][38]
To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos.[31][39] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80 million.[31][40] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[41] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[31][39]
During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[36][42] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[36] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[43][44] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.[21] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[38] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[42] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[43][45] Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.[46]
2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player
""In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy' shirt of one of the world's great clubs.""
– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[47]
On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.[40] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[47] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[48] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[49] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[40][50]
Due to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[50][51] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o.[28][52][53] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[54][52] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, ""We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.""[55] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League,[56] in a 5–0 win over Panathinaikos on 2 November 2005,[57] his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.[46][52]
While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[58][59] Already an idol to the culés, the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[59][60] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[61][62] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[63] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[60] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[64] His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.[65]
Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[66] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's second goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66 yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[18][67] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[68] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[69][70]
After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname ""Messiah"" from the Spanish media.[18][71][72] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[73][74] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[75] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[76] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[77] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[76] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[78]
2008–09: First treble
After two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[53] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[79][80] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[62][81] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[73][82]
In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside Eto'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[83][84] During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[85][86] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[87] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[83][88]
As the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[89] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[85] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[90] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[79]
2009–10: First Ballon d'Or
His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[91] After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[92] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[73]
""Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He's [like] a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make.""
– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[93]
The new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16.[94] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club's summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimović occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[95] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[96][97] He scored all of his side's four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in the competition.[98] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year.[99] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[97][100]
2010–2011: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League
Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat.[101] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[102] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[103][104] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[73][105] Under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.[105]
Towards the end of the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in the span of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[106] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[107][108] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory.[109][110] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league's top assist provider with 18.[111][112] He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, becoming Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.[111][113]
As Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[114] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[115][116][117] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals.[118][119] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[120] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[121] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[122] By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[22]
2012: A record-breaking year
""I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's impossible, this kid is unique.""
– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer at the age of 24 in March 2012[123]
As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[124][125] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[126][127] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[128]
Despite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end.[129] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[130][131] In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[132] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[133][134]
Under manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in Spanish football.[135] A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[136] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed ""with respect and admiration"", after breaking his 40-year record.[137] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[138] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[139][140] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[138][141]
2013–2014: Messidependencia
Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health.[142] After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi.[143] Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13 million.[144][145] He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[146] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.[147]

– Defender Gerard Piqué explains Barcelona's reliance on an unfit Messi against Paris Saint-Germain in April 2013.[148]
After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[149] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[149]
Messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[150] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[151][152] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[153][154] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[155][156] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[157]
During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[158][159] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[158][160] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[159][161] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[162] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[163] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[164] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[165]
2014–15: Second treble
Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[166] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[167] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[168] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[169]
At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed ""MSN"", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[170][171] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[171][172] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[173][174] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[175]
Towards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[176] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[177] As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 3] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[178][179][180] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[181]
In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[182] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[183][184] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[185][186] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[175] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[187][188] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[189]
2015–16: Domestic success
Messi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[190] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[191] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[192] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[193] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[194]
On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[195] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[196] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as ""a touch of genius"", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, ""Barca's forwards are very respectful."" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was ""very happy"" with the play, insisting ""it was legal and entertaining"".[197][198]

August 2020: Desire to leave Barcelona

– Messi on reversing his decision to leave Barcelona in an interview with Goal on 4 September 2020.[285]
Following growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[286] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club ""a document expressing his desire to leave"" on 25 August 2020.[287] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi's statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[288] On 26 August, Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club's desire to ""build a team around the most important player in the world""[289] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi's contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player's representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season.[290] On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi's contract and buyout clause were still active.[291]
On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel's father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause ""is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player's unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season"", as stated in Messi's contract with Barcelona;[292] moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[293] Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[294] This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying ""I would never go to court against the club of my life"".[295]

After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell's Old Boys, in tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both hands to the screen showing Maradona's face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[301] On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men's Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.[302]

– Messi on his difficult first season at PSG and how he wants to improve in his second season in an interview with TyC Sports.[331]

After adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in a attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31 July by scoring PSG's first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions, winning his second trophy with PSG.[341]
Due to his previous form last season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d'Or award for the first time since 2005.[342] On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbappé, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1's second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7–1 away win over Lille.[343][344] The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in September.[345] On 5 October, he scored in a 1–1 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition's history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents.[346] On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7–2 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals.[347] Four days later, Messi scored and provided an assist as PSG won 4–3 against Troyes to remain top of the Ligue 1 table.

International career
2004–2005: Success at youth level
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[351] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[352]
Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[353][354] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[354]
2005–2006: Senior and World Cup debuts
In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[355] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[356] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his ""re-debut"" ahead of the match.[357] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as ""a jewel"".[358] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[359] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[360]
During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[361] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[362][363] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[364][365] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[366] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.[367][368]
2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold
As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[59][369] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[370][371] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[369] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[372] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[369] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[373]
Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[374] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[375] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[376] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[377]
2008–2011: Collective decline
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[369] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[359][378] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[379] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[359] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[380]
Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[378] He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[381]
Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[382] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his ""outstanding"" pace and creativity and ""spectacular and efficient"" dribbling, shooting and passing.[383] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[384]
Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[384][385] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[111][359] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[384]
2011–2013: Assuming the captaincy
After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.[386][387] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[359][386]
Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[359][386] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[388] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[359][389] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[386]
2014–2015: World Cup and Copa América finals
Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[390] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[391] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[392] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[393] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[394][395] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[396]
Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[397] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[398] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[390][399] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[400]
Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[401][402] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[403] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[404] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[359][404]
As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[405] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[406] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[405] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[407] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[408] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[409]
2016–2017: Third Copa América final, retirement, and return
Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[410] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[411] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[412] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[413]
""Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, 'he's the top scorer for the Argentina national team.' But the advantage I have is that I'm second to an extraterrestrial.""
– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[414]
On 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[415] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[416] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[417] and was named man of the match once again.[418]
During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[419] He stated, ""I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.""[420] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, ""My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.""[421] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[422] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[423]
Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[424] He was greeted by fans with signs like ""Don't go, Leo"" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, ""We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.""[425] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[426] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[427]
""A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.""
– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[428]
Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[429] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[430] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[431]
On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[432][433] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[434] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[435] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[435]
2018: World Cup
""The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]""
– Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.[436]
Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[437][438] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[439] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[440] In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying ""we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle"".[441] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, ""Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone.""[442]
In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[443] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[444][445] He was awarded Man of the Match.[446] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[447] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[448] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[449][450]
Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[451] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[452] A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire.[453] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[454]
2019–2020: Copa América third-place, suspension and Superclásico victory
On 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni's final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.[455] In Argentina's second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[456] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[457] Following Argentina's 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match,[458][459] and alleged the competition was ""set up"" for Brazil to win.[460]
In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[461] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[462] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[463] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[464] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[465] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[466]
2021–2022: Copa América and World Cup triumphs
""It was clear to me that I had to try until the last tournament and that I couldn't withdraw from the national team without winning something.""
– Messi on winning the 2021 Copa América in an interview with Diario Sport.[467]
On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[468] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[469] A week later, he broke the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[470] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[471] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[472][473] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[474][475] Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament's top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[476][477]
On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[478] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[479] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.[480]
At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[481] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance,[482] and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records.[483][484] In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[485] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[486] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all–time top–scorer at the World Cup.[487] Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[488][489]
In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup finals appearance at Lusail Stadium. Messi scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in each round of a single World Cup edition.[490] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[491] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé.[490] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).[492] The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé.[493][494][495][496] Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying ""I want to continue playing as a champion"".[497]
2023–present: Post World Cup triumph and 100 international goals
Following the World Cup, Messi made his return to Argentina as world champion for two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal from a free-kick in Argentina's 2–0 friendly win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[498] In the following match against Curaçao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, in a 7–0 win. This achievement also marked a new milestone for Messi, as he became the third player to score 100 international goals.[499]
Player profile
Style of play
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[500][501] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (""The Atomic Flea"").[502][503][504] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[15][501][505] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[506] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, ""Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.""[44] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[507][508]
A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[509] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[510][511][512] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[501][513] As of October 2022, Messi ranks 9th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 60,[514] the most among active players.[515] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[516]
Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[505][513][517] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[518] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[519] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, ""The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.""[508] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[500][501]
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[380] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[44] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[22] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[172][520] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[521][522] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[523] or even on the right wing[524] or as a false nine,[525][526] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[522] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[527][528]
As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[529][530][531] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[532] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[385][533]
Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona
""I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.""
– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[66]
A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[59] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, ""I'm not even the best at Barça"", in reference to his protégé.[534][535] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[73] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[11][505][536] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[537] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[113][538] and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[539][540] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[541] until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.[542]
Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the ""New Maradona"" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[19][378] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, ""Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.""[543] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays ""at the level of the best Maradona"".[544] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[545][546][547]
In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[351][548][549] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[15][351] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[384] Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi ""was always seen as more Catalan than one of them"".[550] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: ""Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.""[551] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[552][553][554] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become ""more one of the group, more Argentine"", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[550]
Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo
Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[555][556]
Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[557][558] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[158] Since 2008, Messi has won seven Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[559] six FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[560] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[158][561] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[562][563][564] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[565] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[565]
In popular culture
According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[163][566] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[567] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[568] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[569] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[79][80][144] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus.[570] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[570] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[571]
In addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[572] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[573] Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[565] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[574][575] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[576] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[577]
As a commercial entity, Messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[579][580] From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[579][581] Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[582][583][584][585] Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[586][587]
Messi's global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people as published by Time, in 2011 and 2012.[588][589] His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by August 2021 he had over 103 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[590][591] He also has over 400 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[592] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes.[593] According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[594][595] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a ""tourist attraction"".[596]
Other events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.25 million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[597] In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137 million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[598][599] World Press Photo selected ""The Final Game"", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[600] Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[601]
In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, ""sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.""[602] In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[603][604] In August 2022, Messi was urged by the family of Mohammed al Faraj to intervene on their son's behalf after he was arrested in 2017 at the age of 15 for crimes against the Saudi regime and faced the death penalty.[605]
Personal life
Family and relationships
Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[606] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[607] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[608]
""Leo is not shy. He's introverted. He's reserved.""
— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 4] who addressed Messi's growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.
Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[610] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[611] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[612] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[613] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[614] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.[615]
Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[616]
Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of ""The Machine of '87"" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[15][617][618] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[619] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[620] His favourite meals include asado (traditional South American barbecue), milanesa and pasta, and he prefers his mate unsweetened.[621]
Philanthropy
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[622][623] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[624] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[625]
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[626] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[617] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[617][627] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global ""Messi and Friends"" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[628][629]
Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[617] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[15] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[630] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[631] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[632] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[633]
In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[634][635] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[636]
In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[637] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that ""Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones"".[637]
Tax fraud
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[638] Facing the judge, he said, ""I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.""[639]

Notes
- ^ According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single ""Messi"", in accordance with Argentine customs.[3][4] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double ""Messi Cuccittini"".[5] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: ""The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders.""[6]
- ^ In addition to four FIFA Ballons d'Or, Messi received France Football's Ballon d'Or and FIFA's World Player of the Year award in 2009 prior to their incorporation; both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballons d'Or.[7][8] In 2019, he received a sixth Ballon d'Or and won the Best FIFA Men's Player, before receiving a seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. He was named the Best FIFA Men's Player for the second time in 2022.
- ^ Assist statistics began in 1990.
- ^ According to Bleacher Report's Richard Fitzpatrick, ""Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment.""[609]
- ^ a b Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[650][651] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions.[652]

Cristiano Ronaldo made history Thursday as the first male player to score in five World Cups in Portugal's opening game in Qatar against Ghana.
The Portugal captain scored in the 65th minute from the penalty spot -- the 118th goal for his country -- to open the scoring at Doha's Stadium 974. Portugal went on to win 3-2 as goals from Joao Felix and Rafael Leao helped them weather two late efforts from Ghana.

Ronaldo, 37, is the most prolific goal scorer in men's international football and has made a record 18 appearances for Portugal at a World Cup.
""It's a beautiful moment, in my fifth World Cup. We won, we started off on the right foot, a very important victory,"" Ronaldo said of the milestone. ""We know that in these competitions winning the first game is crucial. Another record too, the only player to score in five consecutive World Cups, that for me it is a reason of great pride.
""I am very happy for the team to have given an excellent performance. Difficult, but fair win.
""The important thing was that the team won. The [Manchester United] chapter is closed, and the focus is solely and exclusively on the World Cup. As I said, we wanted to start off on the right foot. We won, we played well, I helped the team. Everything else is not important. The important thing is the national team.""
His latest landmark comes after he left Manchester United by ""mutual agreement"" earlier this week following an explosive TV interview in which he criticised the club and coach Erik ten Hag.
The forward made his Portugal debut in 2003 and scored his first goal 10 months later during a Euro 2004 group stage game against Greece.
His first World Cup goal, in 2006, was from the penalty spot in a 2-0 win over Iran. His next World Cup goal came four years later in South Africa in a 7-0 rout of North Korea. Ronaldo also scored in Portugal's 2-1 win over Ghana in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but his side faced disappointment as they were eliminated in the group stage.

The first player to score in five World Cups, men's or women's, was Marta in 2019, and Christine Sinclair matched the feat that same year.
Ronaldo's most successful World Cup campaign was in 2018 in Russia, where he scored four goals, including a hat trick in a 3-3 draw with Spain. The last of those goals came in the 88th minute, a 25-yard free-kick that flew into the top left corner past United teammate David de Gea.
Portugal's best performance with Ronaldo was the 2006 World Cup, when they finished fourth.
By scoring in Thursday's Group H game against Ghana, his eighth goal at a World Cup, he is one strike from equalling the country's record in the competition, set by Portugal legend Eusebio. Eusebio helped Portugal reach third place at the 1966 World Cup in London, where he finished as the top scorer with nine goals.
Ronaldo's finest hour in international football came when he captained Portugal to Euro 2016 glory against hosts France with a 1-0 victory. It was Portugal's first major title, and it was followed by UEFA Nations League glory three years later.
Cristiano Ronaldo wrote on Instagram: ""Very important win in our World Cup opener but nothing is won! It was just the first step! We remain focused on the pursuit of our objectives. Strength Portugal!"""

Morocco dumped Spain out of the World Cup in a last-16 penalty shootout on with Spanish-born Achraf Hakimi scoring the decisive spot-kick after Spain squandered all three of their attempts, following a 0-0 draw over 120 minutes. The win took the North African nation to its first-ever quarterfinal.

Hakimi, a product of the Real Madrid youth system, calmly slotted his penalty past Unai Simon in Spain's goal to seal Morocco's 3-0 win in the shootout.
During the 90 minutes plus extra time, Spain dominated possession but failed to create many clear chances against Morocco’s stubborn defense.
Morocco advanced to a quarter-final clash. It was a historic occasion as Morocco became only the fourth African team to reach the quarterfinals of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002, and Ghana in 2010. Morocco also became the first African nation to win a penalty shoot-out in the FIFA World Cup finals.
Although it was a team effort but one man who stood out for Morocco in the crunch moment was the goalkeeper Yassine Bounou. The Moroccon shot-stopper also created a bit of history for himself as he became the first African goalkeeper ever to save two penalties in a FIFA World Cup penalty shootout.

DOHA, Qatar -- Having made his international debut in 2008, it did not take long for Eiji Kawashima to establish himself as Japan's first-choice goalkeeper.
Two years later, he would feature for the Samurai Blue at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa -- the first of four consecutive tournaments he would be present at with Kawashima currently part of the squad at Qatar 2022.
Things are slightly different for him this time around though.
Having been -- quite literally -- the first name on the Japan starting XI at the past three editions of the World Cup, Kawashima is now only No. 1 in jersey allocation with Shuichi Gonda currently the main man in goal for coach Hajime Moriyasu.
The fact that the Strasbourg man is playing a lesser role these days is hardly surprising considering he will turn 40 in March, although he remains in supreme condition, and is no longer getting as much regular first-team football at club level as would be expected from a national team's starting goalkeeper.
Yet, that does not mean Kawashima has not been performing his role for the team in a remarkable campaign thus far, which has seen them claim dramatic come-from-behind wins over powerhouses Germany and Spain to reach the Round of 16 for the second consecutive tournament.
Having always displayed quiet but firm leadership qualities, the sheer experience of the Saitama native makes him a calming presence in the dressing room and a pillar of support for the younger members of the playing group.
In the immediate aftermath of Japan's win over Spain, when it looked like the frenzy of photographers clicking away by the sidelines was at risk of spilling over and into the players on their lap of honour, the powerfully-built 1.85 metre Kawashima was almost playing the role of half-protective big brother, half-menacing bodyguard -- ensuring no harm was going to befall the likes of Takefusa Kubo and Ritsu Doan.
From the warmups in training and before matches, Kawashima almost doubles up as a second goalkeeping coach for Gonda and the bond between them -- and the third option in Daniel Schmidt -- has been emblematic of the 'goalkeepers' union' -- best illustrated when the reserve duo wildly charged straight towards the first-choice to celebrate at the final whistle of Thursday's triumph over the Spanish.
Perhaps most importantly, his sheer availability will help keep Moriyasu's mind at ease, knowing he has a seasoned campaigner ready to be called upon whenever the need arises.
""For sure (this World Cup has been different). For the last three World Cups, I played in all the games,"" Kawashima told ESPN exclusively.
""But I'm always loyal for the Japanese national team because it is always an honour to be here.
""I'm really excited to be part of this team and what we're achieving, including this amazing result (against Spain). So I just try to give my everything to this team.
""It's been really amazing. This group was really tough -- we had Germany and Spain. It was difficult but we believed in ourselves and it has been a good result.""
Known for being fluent in seven languages, the well-spoken Kawashima has exuded a sense of maturity and being grounded even in his younger days.
His ability to accept the fact that he now has to settle for a back-up role behind Gonda could easily stem from the fact that he was once on the other side of the equation -- back at the 2010 World Cup when he was expected to be an emergency option for the Samurai Blue but ended up being promoted to the starting XI ahead of two veterans in the presumed No. 1 Seigo Narazaki and legendary captain Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
It is this very quality of being level-headed that is also keeping him from getting overly carried away with what the Japanese have achieved so far in Qatar.
""No, no, no -- we've got to win game by game,"" Kawashima hastily dismissed, when asked if they could start dreaming of potentially getting to a World Cup final.
""Now we're really confident but also modest. We know our potential, we believe that we can do something.
""We believed in ourselves (that we could beat Spain) -- that was our goal. Now, for sure the next game (against Croatia) will be a difficult game too, but we'll try to do our best.""
That much is for certain.
Whether it has been in one of those 95 caps he has already won for Japan, or more recently on the sidelines as a figure of leadership and support for his younger peers, Kawashima can always be counted on to do his best for the Samurai Blue cause."

FIFA World Cup 2022 Final: Kylian Mbappe won the Golden Boot Award in the 2022 edition of the tournament pipping Lionel Messi in an incredible burst in the second half of the game.
In Short
- 23-year-old Kylian Mbappe scored 2 stunning goals in the FIFA World Cup Final
- Mbappe turned the game on his head singlehandedly
By India Today Web Desk: Kylian Mbappe pipped Lionel Messi in an epic finish to the Golden Boot race in the final of the FIFA World Cup 2022. Messi and Mbappe came into the final of the FIFA World Cup with 5 goals each but Messi was the one to take a lead after converting his penalty in the first half.
Things seemed lost for France late in the second half when they were trailing 2-0 against Argentina and had not taken a single shot till the 70th minute of the game. However, Mbappe had other ideas a produced a tremendous burst of two minutes scoring 2 goals to turn the game on its head.
Mbappe goals stunned Argentina who looked devastated after losing the grip of the game. Mbappe kept becoming more threatening as the game progressed in the final minutes of the game and kept the Argentine defence on its toes with his pace.
Mbappe pipped Lionel Messi's 7 goals in the tournament, and scored 8 of his own, with 2 goals coming from penalties. At regulation time, Mbappe was ahead of Messi but the Argentine captain drew level in the dying moments of extra time, tapping in a rebound from Hugo Lloris.
Messi now holds the record of scoring at least one goal in all the knockout matches of the FIFA World Cup, has scored 4 goals from penalties.
The Argentine captain was once again taken over by Mbappe in the extra time, when Montiel conceded a penalty in the 118th minute of the game. Mbappe converted his final shot on goal and finished the tournament with 8 goals, and straight out beat Messi in the number of goals. This meant that Mbappe, at just 23, is now a Golden Boot winner at the FIFA World Cup, and has the most number of finals goals in the FIFA World Cup."

World Cup: FIFA speaks on Ronaldo’s controversial penalty against Ghana
FIFA’s expert World Cup analysts have said Cristiano Ronaldo performed a stroke of “genius” to win the penalty for Portugal in their 3-2 win over Ghana at the 2022 World Cup.
Ronaldo became the first male footballer to score at five World Cups on Thursday.
The 37-year-old converted a controversial penalty after the referee adjudged that he was brought down by Ghana defender Mohammed Salisu.
Ghana coach, Otto Addo, claimed it was a “special gift” for Portugal after the match.
FIFA’s Technical Study Group (TSG) held a media briefing in Doha, in which they claimed this year’s World Cup is on track for a record number of awarded penalties.
“Maybe the strikers are getting smarter?
“If you look at the penalty that Ronaldo got, people can say what they want about this man, but the smartness and the ingenious thought to just be patient and wait for that split second to touch the ball first before you, and continue my leg so that your contact will hit my leg, that is total genius,” former Colombia goalkeeper and TSG panel member, Faryd Mondragon, said.
A total of nine penalties have been awarded in the first 16 games.
At this rate, the World Cup is on track for a record 36 in the entire 64-game tournament."

FT - It's all over! France beat Morocco 2-0 to set up final date with Argentina
France set up a heavyweight World Cup final against Argentina after an early goal by Theo Hernandez and a late one from Randal Kolo Muani ended battling Morocco’s dream run via an action-packed 2-0 semi-final victory on Thursday. Full back Hernandez stretched high after five minutes to hook in the first goal Morocco have conceded to an opposition player in the tournament after a scramble in the box, but the holders offered only occasional glimpses of their class. Morocco, disrupted by early injuries to two key defenders, recovered to cause no end of problems, with Hugo Lloris brilliantly saving Jawad El Yamiq's overhead kick at the end of the first half and the outsiders pouring forward for much of the second. However, they could not quite fashion a clear enough chance for the equaliser and were unable to extend the astonishing run that included victories over Belgium, Spain and Portugal and made them the first African team to make the semi-finals. France settled it in the 79th minute when a brilliant dribble by Kylian Mbappe set up Kolo Muani to tuck in the decisive goal with his first touch less than a minute after coming on. France will be hugely relieved to become the first defending champions to reach successive finals since Brazil in 2002 and can now look forward to Sunday's showdown when they will bid to follow Brazil (1962) and Italy (1938) as the third team to retain the title.

Footballers from across the world have been showcasing their talent for their teams. However, all countries can’t take part in the FIFA World Cup because there is a limit on the number of teams. There is a huge fan following in India who wants to see their country playing at the World Cup. But this time again, India did not play in Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 because they were eliminated in the second round of the Asian World Cup qualifiers and were placed 3rd in Group E with seven points.
Football in India is quite popular and many states in India have regional governing bodies as there are 37 state associations affiliated with the All India Football Federation. Indian football has come a long way and different football clubs and franchises have seen a catastrophic change in the face of the world’s most loved sport in recent decades.
The Suspension of AIFF by FIFA
Recently, the Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) suspended the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The sudden suspension came after FIFA suspected undue third-party interference in the management of the AIFF, a breach of FIFA’s statutes. However, this ban was lifted after a few days, but even then the case was very embarrassing for India.
Team India: A “Sleeping Giant” in Football World?
In 2006, then FIFA president Sepp Blatter described India as a ‘sleeping giant’ in the football world. From the national team line-up to the domestic tournaments, there have been humongous changes in recent years, but the blue tigers have failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.
The young players from India are doing quite well in domestic leagues and may have won hearts, and attracted huge crowds to their matches, but the fact remains that Indian football still has a long way to go before it can earn the status to play in the FIFA World Cup.
Led by Sunil Chhetri, the Indian football team was knocked out in the second round of the qualifying stage. India is in the 106th position in the official ranking of FIFA and even failed to acquire a spot in the top hundred. Many people believe that the biggest reason for India not qualifying for FIFA WC is that football is not as popular as cricket in India. Many people prefer cricket over football, so talent is not recognized. The Indian football team is working hard to be one of the best but less media coverage and inappropriate sponsorship are becoming a big factor in the Indian team’s game.

When was the last time India qualified for the FIFA WC?
The Indian football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup held in Brazil in 1950 and despite this, the team did not play in the World Cup.
India was scheduled against Sweden, Italy, and Paraguay in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. But FIFA banned India from the tournament for ‘disagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time. But there were rumors that the Indian team wanted to play barefoot but wasn’t allowed.
Since then, India has never qualified for the quadrennial FIFA showpiece. Interestingly, several members of the Indian team competed in the 1948 London Olympic football tournament barefoot, with their feet bound in bandages to prevent injury.
Top Reasons Why India is not so popular in the Football World
India: The craze for Cricket Over Football
The condition of all sports apart from cricket is nearly the same when we consider fan support. Cricket is considered a religion in India as billions of Indians watch and follow cricket. Other leagues like ISL and PKL have been gaining popularity but not as same as IPL. In many games of the Indian national football and a few I-league clubs, the attendance to these games averages around 20k to 40k (except for a few games like the Kolkata derby).
It makes a massive difference if you have a huge crowd cheering for you and your team.

Lack of Infrastructure & Long-Term Vision
The Lack of infrastructure and long-term vision are two of the biggest factors creating hindrances in the growth of football in India. India lacks a quality football stadium. Few of the biggest and most popular clubs in India don’t have proper training and medical facilities.
In places like Delhi, and other states where this sport is quite popular, the government needs to establish new football centers and provide training facilities to budding talents. In India, football stadiums with international standards are in fewer numbers as compared to the size of the Indian geographical area and fan following. In India, more than 30 million viewers watch the European Football League so it is high time that Indian football should be promoted at the grassroots level.
Promotion of Sport
India is always known as a cricketing nation. One of the major reasons that India held a poor ranking in FIFA is because of the lack of proper facilities and awareness about the sport. AIFF has somehow failed in the promotion of football on the global platform.
The domestic leagues of football have gained huge popularity in India. The arrival of ISL (Indian Super League) has seen a renewed interest in football among the masses. In India, football is popular in states like Goa, Kerala, Manipur, and West Bengal but most ISL clubs don’t have proper training facilities and academies.

1978 v the Netherlands[edit]
Argentina hosted the 1978 edition of the World Cup and reached the final. The Netherlands had already played the previous final in West Germany 1974 - and also lost to the hosts.
Diego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach César Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes, who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals.
The Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later.
The closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time.

Against conferences[edit]
FIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America. Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian (OFC) squad.

Miscellaneous[edit]
Argentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malmö. Germany won 3–1.[11][12]
In the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata's local club Kimberley. France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3–1.[13][14]
The stadium José María Minella is the southernmost World Cup venue located at 38°0′0″S 57°33′0″W / 38.00000°S 57.55000°W. Including France vs. Hungary, several matches of the 1978 World Cup were played in this stadium. Mar del Plata is in the south of Buenos Aires Province.[15]
In addition, Argentina played against Nigeria at Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg in 2018 making it the northernmost game along other six matches. The Russian city is at 59°58′22.63″N 30°13′13.92″E / 59.9729528°N 30.2205333°E.[16]
Referees[edit]
As a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy, where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, Néstor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia. They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament.

The quarterfinal clash at the Lusail Stadium saw a total of 19 bookings, breaking the record of the Portugal vs Netherlands round of 16 match in the 2006 World Cup, popularly known as the ‘Battle of Nuremberg.’
Out of the 19 bookings, two were shown to Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni and support staff Walter Samuel. Netherlands full-back Denzel Dumfries was the only player to see a second yellow during the penalty shootout.
Argentina captain Lionel Messi has slammed the referee after the match, calling him ‘not up to the mark’.
“I don’t want to talk about referees because then they will sanction you,” Messi said during the post-match interview with the organiser, “But we were scared before the game because we knew what was coming [with Mateu Lahoz]. They cannot put a referee like that on this game when he is not up to the level,” he added.
FIFA, however, did over disciplinary proceedings against the Argentina Football Federation after the remarks.
“The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has opened proceedings against the Argentinian Football Association due to potential breaches of articles 12 (Misconduct of players and officials) and 16 (Order and security at matches) of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the Netherlands vs Argentina FIFA World Cup match,” it said in a statement.
In the World Cup 2022, Lahoz officiated three matches and issued 23 yellow cards, which comprised two group stage matches and one quarterfinal. He was in charge of the Qatar vs Senegal and USA vs Iran clashes, respectively. In two games, he issued a total of eight yellow cards."

WHAT HAPPENED? India have recorded the second-highest number of visitors in Qatar with 56,893 fans, according to a report published by FIFA. This is already more than the number of fans who had gone to Russia to watch the World Cup. Saudi Arabia tops the chart with 77, 106 fans while USA, UK and Mexico complete the top five with 36,236, 30,719 and 25,533 supporters respectively at the end of group stages.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: FIFA's numbers also show a cumulative stadium attendance of 2.45 million spectators. It boasts of an average 96 per cent occupancy in each game and is significantly higher than the corresponding 2.17 million figure recorded four years back in Russia.
Though India haven't qualified for the World Cup, the tournament remains popular among Indian fans. The World Cup has also generated a lot of excitement in the country. With Qatar geographically close to the Indian subcontinent, fans from India have utilised the chance to flock to Qatar and revel in the atmosphere of a World Cup.
WHAT THEY SAID?: “It’s been a fantastic World Cup, with groundbreaking figures and memorable moments both on and off the pitch. Fans are having an amazing time in Doha, and the whole world is following with excitement on TV as new records as set every day,” said FIFA COO World Cup, Colin Smith.

Russia had qualified for the World Cup playoffs after finishing second in Group H in the UEFA qualifiers. It was all set to play Poland in the playoff on March 24, when Russian forces began their attack on Ukraine on February 24.
This pushed the three sides in Russia’s playoff pool -- Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden -- to threaten boycott.
On February 28, FIFA and UEFA, under recommendations from IOC, suspended Russia and Russian clubs from participating in the their competitions including the 2022 World Cup.
Russia soon appealed the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but it was turned down on March 18. As a result, Poland got a walkover and then beat Sweden to secure its place in Qatar 2022."

A total of 32 teams will be seen in action across a span of one month, with the final scheduled to be played on December 18. This is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world, and the last to feature 32 teams. From the next edition in 2026, the number of participating teams will increase to 48. France is the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 final. Here are 10 interesting facts about the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
As per Bloomberg, Qatar has spent a whopping $300 billion (Rs 2442000 crore) to organise the World Cup. As per Economic Times, the construction of new stadiums cost $6.5 billion (Rs 530 crore). In comparison, Russia had spent only $14.2 billion (Rs 115913 crore) to organise the 2018 World Cup, per Forbes.
The Qatar World Cup will be played across 28 days, which makes it the shortest football World Cup since 1998. Since the World Cup became a 32-team tournament in 1998, the 2014 edition in Brazil was held over 32 days while the shortest 32-team World Cup was played across 31 days. The opening match of the 2022 World Cup was played on November 20, with the final to be held on December 18.
As the host country, Qatar’s national football team automatically qualified for the World Cup 2022. This is their first appearance at the FIFA World Cup. However, they lost their opening game to Ecuador.
This is the first time that the football World Cup is being played in the months of November and December instead of May, June, or July. Summers in Qatar get harsh, which is why the tournament has been held in winter when the weather is pleasant. This, however, has played a spoilsport to the European league schedules.
18-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko of Germany is the youngest player at the 2022 World Cup. At the Bundesliga in 2022, he helped Borussia Dortmund with three assists and six goals. The oldest player, meanwhile, is Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary, aged 45.
As per The Hindu, more than 1.5 million people applied for the compulsory pass for the tournament. The pass serves as a visa, transport and match ticket and gives access to fan zones. The two international airports in Doha are prepared to handle 150,000 entries a day during the course of the tournament. As per Bloomberg, nearly 3 million tickets had been sold by mid-October.
As per TOI, as many as five billion people are expected to tune in to watch the 2022 World Cup. That is more than half of the world’s population!
There are only eight teams in the world that have won the prestigious FIFA World Cup. Brazil has five wins, while Germany and Italy have four wins each. Uruguay, Argentina and France have two titles each, while Spain and England have one each. Six of these eight teams have won the trophy as a host – England, Italy, Uruguay, Argentina, Germany and France.
Qatar has banned the sale of alcohol at the Fifa World Cup 2022 stadiums. Beer will be available only in hospitality boxes and in fan zones after 7 pm. Pork-based items, balloons, loud music instruments, pride flags and cigarettes are also banned inside the stadiums.
Argentina and Paris Saint-Germain icon Lionel Messi, 35, confirmed in October that Qatar 2022 will be his last, while Portugal and Manchester United player, 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo is yet to make a comment on his future in international football. Messi are Ronaldo are unarguably two of the greatest players to have played the game."

Lionel Messi now has surpassed Diego Maradona with 22 appearances at FIFA World Cup
For Lionel Messi, Argentina's last Group C game is a special one. The Argentine star knows that his team has to win the match in order to qualify for the Round of 16. Lionel Messi reignited Argentina's World Cup challenge with a superb goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico. Messi breathed fresh life into Argentina's campaign with his eighth World Cup goal in his fifth appearance in the finals. The 35-year-old maestro, desperate to crown his glittering career by lifting football's greatest prize, rifled home a low shot on 64 minutes to put Argentina en route to victory. Messi's goal meant he tied the late Diego Maradona on eight goals and 21 appearances at the World Cup for Argentina.
After he was named in the starting line-up against Poland, Messi now has surpassed Maradona with 22 appearances at the World Cup.
In the match against Poland, Enzo Fernandez was rewarded for his World Cup goal against Mexico with his first-ever start for Argentina as manager Lionel Scaloni made four changes to face Poland on Wednesday. The Benfica player replaces Guido Rodriguez in midfield, with Julian Alvarez coming in for Lautaro Martinez up front. The other two changes were in defence, with Nahuel Molina replacing Gonzalo Montiel and Cristian Romero coming back into the side in place of Lisandro Martinez.
Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz made one change, with forward Karol Swiderski coming in for Arkadiusz Milik.
Argentina need a win to be sure of progressing, while a point would be enough if Mexico and Saudi Arabia draw in the other Group C game.
Poland can qualify for the last 16 for the first time since 1986 with a draw.

France were third with an estimated transfer value of 1.34 billion ($1.38bn) for their squad. Paris St Germain (PSG) forward Kylian Mbappe was their top player, with a value of 185 million euros ($190m).
The top three were followed by Spain at 1.2 billion euros ($1.23bn), Portugal at 1.15 billion euros ($1.18bn) and Germany at 1.02 billion euros ($1.05bn).
The CIES Football Observatory put the overall value of all the squads at the World Cup 2022 at 15 billion euros ($15.4bn) based on a statistical technique involving more than 2,000 transactions of players transferred from clubs in the five major European leagues during the period from July 2012 to November 2021.
Insurable value:
In terms of insurable value, England’s squad again topped the list of World Cup teams with an estimated insurable value of 3.17 billion pounds ($3.76bn), according to an analysis by Lloyd’s of London and backed by the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
England edged out France at 2.66 billion pounds ($3.15bn) and Brazil at 2.56 billion pounds ($3.04bn) to claim the top spot.
Lloyd’s said the assessment of insurable value comprises a variety of metrics such as wages, sponsorship, age and on-field positions.
Bellingham was rated the most insurable player, followed by Mbappe and Vinicius Jr.
Lloyd’s model is based on the belief that the quality of a team can be assessed by measuring factors such as player salaries, incomes from endorsements, and ages, as the value of a team is a good indicator of its talent on the pitch."

72,https://olympics.com/en/news/england-at-fifa-world-cup-2022-records-and-stats,"Get all of England's statistics, records, milestones and numbers at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. How are the 'Three Lions' trying to rewrite history? Find out the top facts about Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, Marcus Rashford, coach Gareth Southgate and the rest.
The FIFA World Cup 2022 is entering its decisive phase, and England are keen on seizing the moment for more glory at Qatar.
After topping their group and beating Senegal 3-0 in the round-of-16, the 'Three Lions' have set up a mouth-watering quarter-final clash with France, hoping to rewrite football history .
From captain Harry Kane on the brink of putting himself into England's folklore to Jude Bellingham sprinkling moments of magic in the knockout rounds, the 1966 World Cup winners are leaving their mark on this tournament.
Read on to discover which records have already been broken and what beckons for Gareth Southgate and his side.
Harry Kane is on the verge of immortality for England as he hones in Wayne Rooney's goalscoring record.
The Tottenham Hotspur marksman scored against Senegal to take his goal tally to 52, one away from Rooney's 53 that currently makes him England's top goal-scorer.
Perhaps it is a good omen for Kane that the last time he faced France, he netted twice - something that, if he were to replicate on Saturday evening (10 December), would see him reach the holy grail.
The 29-year-old was playing alongside Rooney the day he broke Bobby Charlton's record in 2015, and the Manchester United legend told Kane that he believed he would be the successor to his goal-scoring throne.
But while the game against Les Blues could be a record-breaking one for the striker, he has already claimed a different one while out in Qatar.
His round-of-16 strike made him the highest English goal-scorer in major tournaments with 11, overtaking Gary Lineker's previous record of 10 - making it seven at the World Cup and four at the European Championships.
The Borussia Dortmund midfielder has been showing that age is merely just a number when it comes to the big stage, emerging as one of England's standout players so far.
The 19-year-old became the first teenager to score for England in this prestegious tournament since Michael Owen in 1998 when he netted the Three Lions' opening goal against the Islamic Republic of Iran in their first outing in Qatar.
Yet again, since Owen in '98, Bellingham became the first teenager to start for England in the World Cup knockout phase when he was named in the starting XI to face Senegal.
During that round-of-16 tie, he assisted Jordan Henderson's opening goal - making him the first teen to assist in the knockout rounds of this competition since records began.
England went on to win that game 3-0, and it was yet another dazzling display from the Dortmund man.
Marcus Rashford rightfully stole the headlines when England beat rivals Wales 3-0 in their final game of Group B.
The 25-year-old Manchester United forward scored twice on the night, opening England's account with a delightful free-kick from just outside the area.
His second came from a venemous strike that flew through Danny Ward's legs and into the back of the net. Not only did it effectively seal the three points, but it also marked England's 100th FIFA World Cup goal.
The first goal for the English at the tournament was netted by Stan Mortensen in 1950.
Other countries to have scored 100 goals or more at a World Cup include Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain.
Not only was England's rampant display against the Islamic Republic of Iran - in which they won 6-2 - a statement victory, it was also an important milestone for manager Gareth Southgate.
The three points meant that Southgate has won more matches at major tournaments for the 'Three Lions' than any of his predecessors, including Sir Alf Ramsey who won eight.
Another win in the group stage (vs Wales) and first knockout stage (vs Senegal) takes his standing tally to 11.
Their last 16 triumph was the sixth knockout game England have won under Southgate's guidance, the same amount they managed to win in the previous 48 years.
There has been a record number of draws at the FIFA World Cup 2022 so far, and England and USA played out the fifth goalless encounter on Friday 25 November.
Despite both sides having their fair share of chances, neither could find a breakthrough and had to share the points in the end.
The occassion marked 22nd draws at World Cups for the 'Three Lions', which is a record. Italy has the second most with 21 draws.
Their stalemate with the USA resulted in them hitting a milestone for draws, but England have been firing on all fronts in their other games.
In fact, they have scored 12 goals across their four games so far in Qatar, their joint-most at a single major tournament.
It equals their tally from the prevous World Cup in 2018, where they went on to bow out in the semi-finals against Croatia.
The English will need to be in full goal-scoring flow to beat rivals France in the quarter-finals and reach the semi-finals for a second successive time in this competiton.
With a place in the last-eight confirmed, there is still time for England to continue writing their name in the history books - but their biggest test of the tournament is up next.
Southgate and his side are set to take on reigning champions France in the quarter-finals, with a place in the last four at stake.
That fierce battle will take place on Saturday 10 December, kicking off at 10pm local time. That is 7pm GMT and 8pm CET."
73,https://olympics.com/en/news/world-cup-2022-female-referees-top-facts-qatar,"Women referees have been selected to officiate at the FIFA men's World Cup for the first time in history. Here are the top things you need to know about Yamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart.
Three referees are making history as they will officiate at the men's football World Cup in Qatar.
Stephanie Frappart, Yamashita Yoshimi and Salima Mukansanga are among the 36 referees selected for the tournament.
The final is scheduled for December 18.
They will also be joined by Neuza Back of Brazil, Mexico's Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt who are headed to the World Cup as three of 69 assistant referees.
Here's what you need to know about FIFA's trailblazing officiating trio.
The French official is arguably one of the most recognised names listed for the 2022 World Cup.
Stephanie Frappart will become the first woman in history to officiate a men's World Cup match when Germany play Costa Rica on Thursday (1 December).
She was already the fourth official in Mexico's game with Poland earlier in the tournament.
The 38-year-old has a career littered with firsts, and in Qatar she will continue to blaze a trail in her wake.
Frappart took the reigns in her first final in 2019 at the World Cup in France, and went on to officiate at the UEFA Super Cup final in the same year.
In 2020 she made waves in the refereeing world, writing her name in the history books by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men's Champions League match. A year later, Frappart would lead the way as Atletico Madrid faced Chelsea in a second leg round of 16 tie in the women's UCL.
Before being announced as part of the plans for Qatar, she also refereed the 2022 Coupe de France final.
Frappart's conduct on the pitch speaks for itself, and has resulted in her winning IFFHS World's Best Woman Referee award three years on the bounce from 2019.
The presence of women officials at the men's World Cup will send a ""strong"" message, according to the Frenchwoman.
""It's a strong sign from FIFA and the authorities to have women referees in that country,"" she said, adding her hopes that this decision can ""make things happen"".
Japanese referee Yamashita Yomishi will appear at a second consecutive World Cup after officiating the 2019 Women's World Cup in France.
She also took charge at the 2020 Olympic Games, held in 2021, in a game between the United States and Sweden.
But refereeing in Qatar won't be the only time she has made history this year.
Yamashita was on the whistle for Melbourne City's 2-1 win over Jeonnam Dragons in the AFC Champions League, and FC Tokyo's 2-0 win over Kyoto Sanga in the J1 League - becoming the first female referee to do so.
The 36-year-old is relishing in the opportunity to be part of history, in spite of the pressures that come with it.
""There are hardly any female referees in the Middle East, so I would like to see that change, with the Qatar World Cup as the catalyst,"" she said.
""The fact that women are officiating for the first time at a men's World Cup is a sign to other people that women's potential is always growing and that is something I also feel strongly about.""
Rwandan referee Salima Mukansanga has been officiating for FIFA since 2012.
But as a young girl, her dream was to play basketball professionally.
""I liked basketball and wanted to take it very seriously,"" she told New Times.
""But access to basketball infrastructure was hard, that's how I ended up in refereeing, which I have also never regretted.""
And that decision has led her to the 2019 Women's World Cup, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, and now Qatar.
Much like Yamashita, she also involved in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics last year.
Mukansanga is no stranger to the world stage, having also taken charge at the men's Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year.
When named as an official for the 2019 WWC, she said: “Officiating at the World Cup is every referee’s dream,"" and for the trailblazing Rwandan, the dream continues next month.
The trio will be joined by three more female officials as FIFA selects 69 assistant referees for the World Cup.
The aforementioned Back, Medina and Nesbitt will all write their names in the tournament's folklore.
Each of them have had their different routes into the profession, but will share a unified history-making moment when they officiate in Qatar.
Medina began her career in refereeing by pure chance, but believes it is a position that ""makes you fall more and more in love every day [with football].""
USA's Nesbitt started refereeing as a summer job, but up until the 2019 WWC was a professor of chemistry.
In 2020, she was named the MLS Assistant Referee of the Year - becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat.
""It has been an absolute honour to have people say that I’ve become a role model for women,"" Nesbitt told FIFA.
37-year-old Back didn't even realise that she had been selected in the 69-name list until she heard it in the press.
""It's very cool, indescribable, it's a moment of joy, of gratitude, and also a little sense of responsibility,"" Back told the media.
Despite any outside pressures, all the ground-breaking officials selected for Qatar are relishing the opportunity to represent women referees in what could be a defining moment going forward."

Updated: 23 Nov 2022, 01:00 PM IST
Saudi Arabia broke Argentina's 36-match unbeaten streak and secured what turned out to be their fourth win in a world cup match since they had started competing in 1994.
Saudi Arabia's 2-1 victory over Argentina was the first shocker at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Following the game, Saudi Arabia declared a public holiday on November 23 to honour the team's unexpected triumph over Argentina, the two-time champions presently captained by arguably the greatest player of all time - Lionel Messi.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino was present for the game, when this happened.
DFB, the Germany football association, soon released a statement regarding the protest: “We wanted to use our captain’s armband to take a stand for values that we hold in the Germany national team: diversity and mutual respect.”
“Together with other nations, we wanted our voice to be heard. It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn’t the case. That’s why this message is so important to us. Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position,” added DFB in the statement.
Nancy Faeser, the German minister of the Interior and Community, was seen along with German Football Association President Bernd Neuendorf, wearing the ‘OneLove’ armband in the stands
Earlier this week, Football Associations of seven nations released a joint statement, advising their players against wearing the ‘OneLove’ armband.
The armband represents support for equality and while it is not solely aimed at the rights of the LGBTQ community, it is significant in Qatar where homosexuality is illegal.
“We are very frustrated by the FIFA decision which we believe is unprecedented - we wrote to FIFA in September informing them of our wish to wear OneLove armband to actively support inclusion in football and had no response” said the joint statement of seven nations which includes England , the Netherlands, Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.
Neuer, along with the captains of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, England, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales, were reportedly set to wear the One Love armband during this edition of FIFA World Cup which commenced on November 20."

- It become the first host nation in the tournament's history to lose its opening match.
- Félix Sánchez's side was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador.
Qatar became the first host nation of the World Cup to ever lose its opening game at the tournament as it was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador on Sunday.
Striker Enner Valencia appeared to have opened the scoring after just three minutes in front of a packed crowd at Al Bayt Stadium, however his header was ruled out for an offside in the build-up.
But it didn't take Valencia long to find the net again, this time from the penalty spot in the 16th minute after he was brought down in the box by Qatar keeper Saad Al Sheeb.
Valencia then added his and Ecuador's second with a fine header in the 31st minute to complete the scoring.
""Ever since the draw took place I dreamt about this game,"" Valencia, who formerly played in the English Premier League for West Ham United and Everton and whose brace against Qatar saw him become his country's record World Cup goalscorer, told reporters after the match.
""I dreamt about playing in this opening game and winning - so it really is a dream come true. These games are about moments. We were able to score two early goals and it allowed us to take control.""
Qatar failed to register a single shot on target in the whole game, with striker Almoez Ali heading wide Qatar's best chance towards the end of the first half.
The disappointing performance prompted a large number of the host nation's fans to leave the stadium at the interval.
""It was won in the first half, a poor second half,"" said the former England men's striker turned BBC pundit Alan Shearer. ""Ecuador managed the game, kept the ball when they had to. It was flat in the second half, even the crowd disappeared after half-time.""
The former England women's star Alex Scott added: ""The disappointing thing with Qatar was, even when they got some possession, they were so sloppy with it. They gave it away.
""It could be a long group stage for the hosts.""
Any hopes of reaching the World Cup knockout phases now look bleak for Qatar.
The host, which is 50th in the FIFA world rankings, the third lowest of any team at the World Cup, next faces reigning Africa Cup of Nations champion, 18th ranked Senegal, on November 25.
It then faces Netherlands, which is ranked eighth, in its final Group A game on November 29.
Fail to make the last-16 and Qatar will become only the second host nation in World Cup history to ever go out at the group stage of the tournament.
The other was South Africa in 2010."
