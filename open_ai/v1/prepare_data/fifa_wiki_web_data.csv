Taking the knee (or taking a knee) is a symbolic gesture against racism whereby an individual kneels upon one knee in place of standing to attention for an anthem or other such occasion. It was originated by American football player Colin Kaepernick on September 1, 2016, in protest against the lack of attention given to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. Kaepernick's protest led to a wider series of national anthem protests.[1] It has since been adopted by sports players in countries around the world, including association football in the United Kingdom, in solidarity with Kaepernick's protest against racism, and has been seen worldwide in non-sporting contexts such as the Black Lives Matter protests.[1][2]
U.S. national anthem kneeling protests[edit]
The gesture originated in a 2016 American football game, during which Colin Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid chose to kneel during the playing of the US national anthem, to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality.[3]
""After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest,"" said Reid. ""We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.""[3]
During the 2016 season, a small number of other players also took the knee before matches.[4] Taking a knee became more frequent after then-President Trump criticized the gesture during a rally in September 2017, describing it as a disrespectful act against the United States national anthem and flag, and urging NFL team owners to sack ""son of a bitch"" players who performed it. In response, over a hundred NFL players took the knee in subsequent weeks, along with athletes from other sports, and spectators.[4]
Use in association football[edit]
Taking the knee was used by many clubs before kick-off throughout the 2020–21 English association football season, which was booed by some fans.[5][6][7]
In a June 2020 radio interview, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that he saw the gesture as ""a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation"", adding that he was unaware whether it had a broader history and that it seemed to him to be ""taken from the Game of Thrones"".[8][9][10][11]
In September 2020, Middlesbrough said they would stop taking the knee.[12] In December 2020 players from Millwall and QPR said they would not take the knee, but would instead stand arm-in-arm.[13] By February 2021 other teams had stopped taking the knee, including Brentford,[14] while individual players from other teams such as Wilfried Zaha said they would also stop.[15] Zaha later became the first Premier League player to stop taking the knee.[16] Derby County stopped in March 2021.[17]
On June 8, 2021, prior to an international friendly game between Hungary and the Republic of Ireland, the Irish players were booed by some Hungarian fans prior to kick-off for taking the knee.[18]
The England national team took the knee before matches in 2021's UEFA European Football Championship,[19] resulting in booing from some fans.[20][21][22][23] Conservative MP Lee Anderson stated that he would not watch England games in the tournament as a direct result of this political gesture, saying he believed that ""the vast majority of these fans booing last night are not racist"" and thought they were ""more likely to [...] not share the Marxist views of BLM"".[24][25] Kick It Out's chief executive Tony Burnett considered the booing an example of racism in the sport.[26] The English Football Association later asked fans to respect the players' wishes to take the knee.[27] England players were booed by Poland fans for kneeling against racism ahead of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at National Stadium, Warsaw.[28]
In July 2021, Conservative MP Steve Baker said the Government should start backing players taking the knee,[29] after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel had declined to condemn those who booed.[30][31][32] Keir Starmer, Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Labour Party, said England's players were ""right to take the knee"".[33]
Ahead of the 2022–23 Premier League season, Premier League club captains agreed to their teams no longer taking the knee routinely before matches,[34] instead restricting the gesture to ""significant moments"" of the season.[35] Some captains felt that the gesture had lost its power, and hoped that restricting it would increase its impact.[36] Captains affirmed their commitment towards fighting racism and other forms of discrimination.[37] During the national anthem to start the 2022 FIFA World Cup game between England and Iran, England players took the knee as Iran’s players fell silent in reaction to events going on in their country.[38]
Similar gestures in history[edit]
Josiah Wedgwood pottered the image of a black man kneeling in shackles and depicting slavery on the emblem of the British abolitionist movement during the 18th and 19th centuries—a movement to ban slavery and ill-treatment of people.[39]
In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. knelt in prayer with a group of equalities marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches.[39]

The World Cup is a solid gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970, before the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. It is one of the most expensive trophies in sporting history, valued at $250,000.[1]
The first trophy, originally named Victory, but later renamed in honour of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and lapis lazuli. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil won the trophy outright in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.
The subsequent trophy, called the ""FIFA World Cup Trophy"", was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 karat gold with bands of malachite on its base, it stands 36.8 centimetres high and weighs 6.175 kilograms (30,875 carats).[2] The trophy was made by the Stabilimento Artistico Bertoni company[3] in Italy. It depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holders of the trophy are Argentina, winners of the 2022 World Cup.
Jules Rimet Trophy[edit]
The Jules Rimet Trophy was the original prize for winning the FIFA World Cup. Originally called ""Victory"", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base.[4] In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winner's details. It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb).[5] It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.[6]
During World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it.[7] The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers' requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.[8]
On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall.[9] It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white mongrel dog named Pickles.[10][11]
As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA.[12] The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica.[12] Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.[13]
The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930.[14] It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.[15]
On 19 December 1983, the wooden rear of the cabinet was opened by force with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again.[16] Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime.[17] The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold.[18] Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.[19]
The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb) of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president João Figueiredo in 1984.[17]
New trophy[edit]
A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries.[18][20] Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) or 30,875 carats of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kilograms (150–180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift.[21][22] This is easy to understand since 18 k gold is an alloy made of 18 parts of gold, 5 parts of silver and 1 part of copper with a mean density of 15.6 gr/cm3.[23][24] The trophy weighs 6175 g, this amount of alloy is just a volume of 390 cm3 or, in other words, would be a cube with a side of 7.3 cm, and the World Cup is clearly larger. This argumentation proves that the World Cup is indeed hollow. Moreover, its original manufacturer, who is the same that makes the official replicas, confirmed this characteristic.[25][26]
Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, ""The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory"".[18]
The trophy has the engraving ""FIFA World Cup"" on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zurich, Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final.[27] The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition.[28]
The Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, however, that is no longer the case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language. For example, ""1974 Deutschland"" or ""1994 Brasil"". In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as ""2010 Spain"", in English, not in Spanish.[29][30] This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup.[31]
As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners.[18] FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold.[18] Germany became the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[32] Argentina became the second nation to achieve this feat following their win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Eventual replacement[edit]
Since the base of the trophy only has space for new engravings to be made up until the 2038 World Cup, a new trophy will eventually be made for the 2042 World Cup.[33]

https://keepup.com.au/news/england-3-0-wales-rashford-and-foden-send-three-lions-through-as-group-b-winners-2/,"Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden starred to send England through to the World Cup knockout stage as Group B winners after a 3-0 victory over Wales on Tuesday.
Victory sets up a last-16 clash with Group A runners-up Senegal on Sunday for England, while Wales crashed out in Qatar without a win for the first time in a major tournament.
Foden started at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium after being left out of the goalless draw with the United States on Friday and won the free-kick for Rashford to break the deadlock in the 50th minute.
Manchester City star Foden extended the lead just a minute later before Rashford doubled his account to eliminate an uninspiring Wales from Group B, in which the USA beat Iran to progress as runners-up.

Rashford spurned a glorious ninth-minute opportunity after being denied by the onrushing Danny Ward, who replaced the suspended Wayne Hennessey.
England continued to dominate possession without testing Ward often as Foden blasted over on the turn, while Joe Allen angled a rare Wales chance off target before the break.
A masterful Foden drive ended with an England free-kick in an inviting position before Rashford whipped into the top-right corner to beat an unsighted Ward.
Harry Kane drilled across the area from the right soon after for Foden to convert at the back post, before Jordan Pickford parried from Kieffer Moore to keep Wales at bay.
Ward was again beaten with somewhat ease as Rashford powered through the legs of the goalkeeper, who denied Jude Bellingham to keep the scoreline down late on.
What does it mean? England continue Wales dominance to book last-16 berth
The pressure ramped upon England after an underwhelming showing in the USA stalemate but Southgate's side responded well in their first World Cup meeting with a fellow British side.
England remained patient throughout and reaped well-deserved rewards in a rapid second-half opening to ensure a seventh straight victory over Wales, scoring 14 and conceding just one in that run.
Knockout football is where England have impressed in recent years and Southgate will know it is time to deliver again, while Wales head home after disappointing in just their second appearance in the tournament.
Rashford redemption
Rashford will have been frustrated to chip a presentable opening at the incoming Ward in what proved to be England's best first-half chance.
But the forward made amends after the interval with two goals, while recording game-leading figures for touches in the opposition box (eight), shots (six) and attempts on target (four) in an encouraging showing.
Bale missing on the world stage
Gareth Bale had the fewest touches of any Wales players to complete 90 minutes in both games against the USA and Iran, though a penalty in the first outing somewhat sheltered the Wales captain from criticism.
The 33-year-old was again largely a passenger in the Middle East against England, managing just four passes and seven touches – both the fewest of any player to start – before his half-time removal.

Key Opta Facts:
– England have finished top of their World Cup group for the first time since 2006, when they were eventually eliminated by Portugal at the quarter-final stage.
– Wales are winless in their last eight games in all competitions (D2 L6), losing more games in this run than they did in their first 23 under Rob Page (W10 D8 L5).
– Marcus Rashford's second goal was England's 100th scored at the World Cup, while it made him just the second Manchester United player to score 3+ goals for the Three Lions at a major tournament after Bobby Charlton (1966 World Cup).
– England's nine goals so far at the 2022 World Cup is the most they've scored in the group stages at a single edition of a major tournament (World Cup and EUROs).
What's next?
England face Senegal in five days at Al-Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, while Wales will take time to reflect on an unsuccessful global campaign."

https://theathletic.com/3914522/2022/11/25/world-cup-red-card-history/,"Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey became the first player sent off in the 2022 World Cup, as his team were eventually beaten 2-0 by Iran on Friday.
The Nottingham Forest ‘keeper becomes the 174th player to be sent off at a World Cup, but only the third goalkeeper, joining Gianluca Pagliuca (Italy vs Norway, 1994) and Itumeleng Khune (South Africa vs Uruguay, 2010).

The first-ever player to be sent off in a World Cup match was Peru’s Placido Galindo, against Romania in the 1930 tournament, but Carlos Caszely of Chile was the first player to actually be shown a physical red card when he was sent off against West Germany in 1974.
Here is everything you need to know about red cards at the World Cup…
Players with the most red cards
Throughout the competition, no player has ever been sent off multiple times in one tournament. However, since 1930, two players have been sent off more than once across multiple competitions. Rigobert Song, the current manager of Cameroon, has been sent off twice in the competition (against Brazil in 1994 and Chile in 1998), as has French icon Zinedine Zidane, who was sent off in the 2006 final against Italy, and less famously against Saudi Arabia in 1998.
Teams with the most red cards
Throughout the history of the World Cup, 64 nations have seen a player sent off. The countries with the most red cards in the competition are Brazil (11), Argentina (10), Uruguay (nine), Italy (eight) and Cameroon (eight).
Despite leading the way when it comes to the number of dismissals, Brazil have not picked up any red cards in the past two tournaments.

Referees who have shown the most red cards
Despite only officiating seven World Cup games across three tournaments, Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez issued five World Cup red cards, including two in one game during the 2006 group stage match between Serbia & Montenegro and Ivory Coast (Serbia’s Albert Nad and Ivory Coast’s Cyril Domoraud). French official Joel Quiniou has issued five red cards across his World Cup career, having refereed eight games. That included sending off Uruguay’s Jose Batista in the first minute of their 1986 match against Scotland for a robust challenge on Gordon Strachan.

However, it is Mexico’s Arturo Brizio Carter who holds not only the record for the most red cards shown at World Cups (seven), but also for having shown red cards in the most matches (five).

Red cards in World Cup finals
Across the history of the competition, there have been five red cards in finals, including in 2006 when Zinedine Zidane capped off his professional career by headbutting Marco Materazzi and being sent off in the 110th minute of his last-ever game. Other final dismissals include Dutchman John Heitinga’s against Spain in 2010, Marcel Desailly (France vs Brazil) in 1998, and the double sending-off of Argentina’s Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti against West Germany in 1990.
Of the infamous five, only Desailly ended the day with a winner’s medal. France had led 2-0 when he was sent off in the 68th minute and ended up winning 3-0.
Tournaments with the most red cards
Germany, 2006 (28)
In a way, Zidane’s headbutt was a fitting end to a tournament that was plagued with indiscipline. This competition saw 21 teams pick up at least one red card, with two matches seeing three red cards, and one seeing four.
That quartet of dismissals came during the now infamous Portugal vs Netherlands round-of-16 tie that saw two players sent off from each team (Deco and Costinha for Portugal, Khalid Boulahrouz and Giovanni van Bronckhorst for the Netherlands). Games between Croatia and Australia, and Italy and the USA both saw three red cards.
One of England’s most infamous red cards came in the quarter-finals when a young Wayne Rooney was dismissed for stamping on Portugal’s Ricardo Carvalho. The referee who showed him the red card — Horacio Elizondo of Argentina — also later sent off Zidane in the final.
As if that wasn’t enough madness for one year, English referee Graham Poll also made headlines for issuing three yellow cards to Croatia’s Josip Simunic in the aforementioned match against Australia. Poll failed to realise he had already booked Simunic when he showed him his second yellow card, then booked him a third time a few minutes later and finally showed the red.

France, 1998 (22)
This competition saw 22 red cards shown across 15 teams, with Cameroon and eventual winners France both picking up the most (three). There were three red cards shown in a game once, and two red cards shown in a game four times, the highest across all competitions to date.
The game that saw the most red cards was Denmark’s 1-1 draw with South Africa, where Miklos Molnar and Morten Wieghorst of Denmark, and South Africa’s Alfred Phiri were all sent off by referee John Toro Rendon of Colombia.
The most famous red card in the tournament was probably David Beckham’s in England’s last-16 defeat to Argentina. The Manchester United midfielder saw red for kicking out at Argentina’s Diego Simeone and was made a scapegoat for the defeat by sections of the English press.
South Korea & Japan, 2002 (17)
In 2002, Portugal and Paraguay were the leading offenders with two red cards apiece, with Mexican official Felipe Ramos Rizo making his presence known by issuing four red cards in just three matches. Four referees sent off more than one player in a game during the tournament. That included two for Portugal (Joao Pinto and Beto) in their controversial group stage defeat to co-hosts South Korea.
South Africa, 2010 (17)
The first tournament to take place in Africa saw 17 red cards issued across 13 teams, with Algeria, Australia, Brazil, and Uruguay having two red cards apiece.
The most famous was Luis Suarez’s against Ghana, a goal-line handball which denied Ghana what would surely have been a winner in added time at the end of extra time. Ghana missed the resulting penalty and then lost in the shootout, securing Suarez’s status as one of the most hated men in Ghana.

https://olympics.com/en/news/fifa-world-cup-2022-records-and-stats,"Get all the FIFA World Cup 2022 statistics, records, milestones and numbers from Qatar featuring football players Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Dani Alves and more.
The FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar came to a dramatic conclusion.
This football tournament brought together 32 top national teams from five confederations and produced no shortage of highlights and history.
From Cristiano Ronaldo's striking touch to Lionel Messi's World Cup goals and appearances to French superstar Kylian Mbappe, records were made with every passing game. And how about Morocco becoming the first African nation to reach the semi-finals?
Read on to discover which records have already been broken and the statistics that are sure to make you the toast of any World Cup conversation.
Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) when he netted home a penalty in Portugal’s 3-2 victory over Group H rivals Ghana.
At 37 years and 292 days old on 24 November, with that goal Ronaldo became the oldest player to score for Portugal at the World Cup.
He also holds the record for being the youngest, having scored for his nation at the 2006 World Cup at 21 years and 132 days old.
In taking to the pitch for the game against Ghana in Qatar, Ronaldo additionally joined Lionel Messi, Lothar Matthäus, Antonio Carbajal and Rafael Márquez as the only men to play in five different FIFA World Cups.
But CR7 had to leave Qatar without the coveted trophy after Portugal's shock ext in the quarter-finals after 1-0 loss to Morocco.
After scoring a fifth goal of this World Cup against Croatia, and his 11th overall, Lionel Messi smashed a new string of records for Argentina.
The 35-year-old is now the top-scorer for Argentina in World Cups, surpassing the previous record of Gabriel Batistuta (10), joint-sixth in all-time World Cup scorer charts, and the oldest man to score five goals in a single World Cup tournament.
The semi-final meeting with Croatia also saw him level Lothar Matthaus' record 25 World Cup appearances by a player before he overtook it in the final.
In the tournament's opening stages, Messi became the first player to score in four World Cups for Argentina (2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022) after he netted a penalty in an opening-round loss to Saudi Arabia.
In the final, he scored from the spot to become the first man to score in each of the knockout stages since the round of 16 was introduced at Mexico 1986.
He scored in extra time to make it seven for the tournament and 13 in World Cups. But more than any of that, he lifted the World Cup for the first time in his glorious career.
FIFA World Cup 2022: What records has Lionel Messi broken and what records is he closing in on?
With 10 minutes to go in the World Cup Final, Argentina led 2-0 with Messi on course for the one trophy to have eluded him.
Kylian Mbappe had other ideas.
First, he scored from the spot before sweeping home moments later to take the match into extra time.
And after his PSG teammate had put Argentina back in front, Mbappe converted another penalty to join Geoff Hurst as the only man to score a hat-trick in the World Cup Final and force a penalty shoot-out.
That took Mbappe's tally to eight for the tournament, securing the Golden Boot by one from Messi.
He had already eclipsed Pele as the highest World Cup goalscorer before the age of 24.
But that incredible effort proved in vain as Argentina won on penalties.
Spain’s No.9 Gavi became the first player born in the year 2004 to score a goal in Qatar when his country thumped Costa Rica 7-0 in their opening match of the tournament.
Incidentally, that victory is the record for the most goals Spain has ever scored in a single World Cup match.
He's done it!
With his goal at the end of the first half of France's round-of-16 clash against Poland, Olivier Giroud became France's all-time leading goalscorer with 52 goals, which he later extended to 53 with his headed winner in the quarter-final against England.
The 36-year-old drew level with Thierry Henry's previous mark of 51 when he scored twice in the 4-1 win over Australia.
Hot on the heels of Giroud's goal scoring feat, France's captain Hugo Lloris became his nation's record appearance maker.
The Tottenham goalkeeper won his 143rd cap in the quarter-final win over England, moving him ahead of Lilian Thuram.
Lloris took his tally to 144 in the semi-final against Morocco and then to 145 in the final.
Argentina came to Qatar unbeaten in 36 games, singling them out as one of the favourite to win the entire competition.
However, that run was shattered by the second-lowest ranked team at the tournament, Saudi Arabia, who defeated Argentina in 2-1.
Inaki Williams of Ghana and Nico Williams of Spain made FIFA World Cup history on 24 November after they became the first full siblings to play for different countries at the FIFA World Cup.
There's positive record-making and there's the less so, and unfortuantely for hosts Qatar, they claimed a first they might not want to brag too much about.
In losing their first match 2-0 Ecuador, Qatar became the first hosts of a FIFA World Cup to lose their opening match.
Wales' goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey became the first player at FIFA World Cup 2022 to see a red card after he collided with Iran's Mehdi Taremi.
The card shown was initially a yellow before it was upgraded to a red.
Hennessey is now the third goalkeeper in World Cup history to be sent off with a red card.
England and USA played out the fifth goalless draw of the FIFA World Cup 2022 on Friday (25 November). Six days later, Croatia and Belgium added another 0-0.
The other four goalless draws so far: Mexico 0-0 Poland, Denmark 0-0 Tunisia, Croatia 0-0 Morocco and South Korea 0-0 Uruguay. Meaning Qatar 2022 has set another record, eight teams drawing the opening game 0-0 in the same World Cup for the first time ever.
England's barren draw was the 22nd draw at World Cups which is a record. Italy is now second with 21 draws.
Enner Valencia's goal against the Netherlands was his sixth World Cup goal in a row for Ecuador - no other Ecuadorian player had scored in the meantime.
Valencia scored all three of Ecuador's goals in the group stage of the World Cup in 2014. The South American side did not qualify for the 2018 edition in Russia.
The 33-year-old joins a select group that includes Portugal's legend Eusebio in 1966, Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Russia's Oleg Salenko in 1994.
Robert Lewandowski was in tears after scoring his first World Cup goal in Poland’s 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia.
The Barcelona striker could not hide his emotions after doubling his side's lead with eight minutes remaining to seal victory for his side.
The 34-year-old had gone five World Cup games without a goal and missed a penalty in his team’s opening Group C game against Mexico.
Lewandowski now has over 600 career goals and equalled Pele's tally of 77 international strikes.
His consolation penalty deep into injury time of the round-of-16 defeat to France saw him go one clear of the Brazilian legend.
Portugal's 39-year old centre-back Pepe has become the second oldest outfield player in World Cup after starting in his country's 2-0 win over Uruguay, Cameroon's Roger Milla remains the oldest as he suited up in the World Cup 1994 in the USA aged 42.
Egypt's goalie Essam El-Hadary is still the record holder. He was 45 when he played in the World Cup 2018.
And Pepe also became the second oldest player to score at a World Cup when he headed in a corner for a 2-0 lead in the 6-1 win over Switzerland.
Stephanie Frappart will become the first woman in history to officiate a men's World Cup match when Germany play Costa Rica on Thursday (1 December).
The 38-year-old was already the fourth official in Mexico's game with Poland earlier in the tournament.
Marcus Rashford was the man of the hour in England's World Cup victory over Group B rivals Wales.
The 25-year-old Manchester United player contributed two goals in his country's 3-0 rout s and with his efforts, guaranteed England advanced to the knockout stages on top of their pool.
Notably, Rashford's second goal of the game, a left-footed strike that clipped the keeper's heel, was England's 100th FIFA World Cup goal.
The first goal for the English at the tournament was netted by Stan Mortensen in 1950.
Other countries to have scored 100 goals or more at a World Cup include Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain.
23-year-old Cody Gakpo is the first ever Dutch player to score in all of Netherlands' group stage games at a World Cup.
The PSV Eindhoven striker clinched the record when he opened scoring for Netherlands in their third group stage against Qatar on Tuesday (30 November).
At 37 years and 247 days old, French goalkeeper Steve Mandanda became the oldest player in history to represent France when he started for Les Bleus against Tunisia on Wednesday 30 November.
Dani Alves has accomplished another record in his glittering career. The 39-year-old full-back has become Brazil's oldest captain when he led the record world champion to the field in their clash against Cameroon.
38-year-old Thiago Silva previously held the record for oldest men’s captain and Brazilian male player to star at a World Cup when he started in Brazil’s opening round win against Serbia (2-0). Alves has now surpassed him.
But Silva made World Cup history on his own as the Chelsea star bagged an assist during Brazil's 4-1 win against the Republic of Korea thus becoming the oldest player to assist a goal at the tournament.
Morocco has reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in history after beating Portugal 1-0 on Saturday (10 December).
In doing so, the Atlas Lions became the first African country ever to advance to the World Cup semis. They have only conceeded one goal so far.
And Morocco are clinical from the spot too, with their goalie Yassine Bounou (aka Bono) saving two penalties in the epic 3-0 shootout win over Spain in the last 16. Achraf Hakimi - born and raised in Madrid - converted the decisive penalty for Morocco.
Hard to believe that Walid Regragui only took over as Morocco's coach in August.
Gonçalo Ramos, who started in place of the benched Cristiano Ronaldo, was the star of the show in the quarter-finals opening the scoring just 17 minutes into his competition debut.
The Benfica striker scored the first hat-trick of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and made global headlines.
Spanish referee Antonio Lohoz handed out a record 16 yellow cards to players during Argentina's intense quarter-final win over the Netherlands which went to penalties.
The previous record was 12 yellow cards which were given out in the games Senegal v Uruguay and Cameroon v Germany in the 2022 World Cup, as well as in the 2010 World Cup final between Span and the Netherlands.
Lohoz also yellow-carded Argentina's coach Lionel Scaloni and his assistant coach Walter Samuel. The only player to receive two yellows was Dutch star Denzel Dumfries, the second coming AFTER Lautaro Martinez had converted the decisive penalty in the shootout."

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/world-cup-roundup-italy-north-macedonia-portugal-turkey,"Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski’s last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win.
Italy did not qualify for the World Cup four years ago, missing out for the first time since 1958, but the European champions dominated from the off in Palermo. The hosts became more desperate in their search for a winner after the break, however, as chances continued to come and go before, in stoppage time, Trajkovski arrowed in a stunning winner to spark wild North Macedonian celebrations.
Roberto Mancini’s Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar.
“It is a huge disappointment,” the Italy midfielder Jorginho said. “It hurts, it hurts so much. We have always created and dominated matches but we have not been able to finish teams off. It is not to blame anyone in particular but it is the reality.
“I don’t know why we haven’t been able to do this, I am also involved in this, and it hurts me to think about it.”
Without the veteran pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini through injury, Italy’s makeshift defence was barely troubled in the first half, as all the action took place down the other end.
Domenico Berardi had the best of the openings, having been presented with the ball after the North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski misplaced a pass, but his shot was tame, with Dimitrievski getting back to make the save. Ciro Immobile also wasted a glorious first-half chance for Italy when blazing over the bar from a good position.
Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance. Italy did not look to be in too much danger, but Trajkovski, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Fayha, wrote his name into North Macedonian football folklore with a shot that crept inside the post to stun the home fans.
Portugal moved into the final with a 3-1 win over Turkey, for whom Burak Yilmaz skied a penalty five minutes from full time that would have drawn the sides level.
Roared on by a sold-out Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal dominated the game from the start and went 2-0 up in the first half after Otavio scored one goal and created another for Diogo Jota before half-time. But Fernando Santos’s side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten.
José Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty given by VAR but Yilmaz fired it high over the bar. The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack.
The Sweden substitute Robin Quaison struck in the second half of extra time to secure a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and set up a clash away to Poland.
The Czechs had an early goal ruled out for a foul and the Swedes had the lion’s share of possession for most of the playoff semi-final, but the two sides struggled to break each other down in a game full of tough tackling and wayward passing.
The substitute Mattias Svanberg went closest for the Swedes in normal time, but his header from Emil Forsberg’s corner was aimed straight at the visiting goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.
The game finished scoreless after 90 minutes and appeared to be heading for penalties when Quaison danced through the middle of the defence before exchanging passes with Alexander Isak and coolly slotting home to move his side a step closer to Qatar."

https://www.goal.com/en-in/news/what-happened-confederations-cup-world-cup-warm-up-cancelled/bltc39f7dc2393dfcc8,"Once upon a time, not all that long ago, players and supporters would be given a taste of what was to come at an upcoming World Cup finals when the Confederations Cup was staged 12 months prior to FIFA’s flagship event.
The competition - which started out in Saudi Arabia as the King Fahd Cup - was originally introduced on a biennial basis between 1992 and 2001, before being moved to the World Cup hosts as it eventually became an event which took place every four years.
Why does it no longer form part of the footballing calendar, who can claim to have collected the crown and could it be brought back in the future? GOAL takes a look at all of those questions...
What happened to the Confederations Cup?
In 2019, it was confirmed by FIFA that the Confederations Cup would be consigned to the history books.
The tournament had featured the holders of the World Cup and the continental champions from across the six FIFA regions – AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA.
The competition was last staged in 2017, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with a revision to the international calendar made prior to Qatar 2022.
FIFA took the decision to do away with the Confederations Cup as they instead look to expand the Club World Cup.
That event is set to feature 24 teams heading forward, although the new format had to be shelved in 2021 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the need to reschedule Euro 2020 and the Copa America.
Some may consider it a good thing that the Confederations Cup is no longer up for grabs as no side that collected the trophy went on to savour ultimate glory at the following World Cup finals.
Confederations Cup history: Winners, finals and hosts
The competition became known as the FIFA Confederations Cup in 1997, but continued to be held in the Middle East at that point.
Brazil are the most successful side in the competition's history, claiming top prize on four occasions - including a run of three successive triumphs between 2005 and 2013.

Could the Confederations Cup be revived?Getty
While FIFA are eager to implement grander club competitions, there has been plenty of discussion regarding more frequent international events.
Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who is now FIFA’s chief of global football development, attracted criticism for suggesting that the World Cup could be staged every two years.
While that proposal appears to be off the table for now, a revival of the Confederations Cup – or something similar – could be looked into by world football’s governing body.
FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani told Reuters in December 2021: “The principle of having an event, in between World Cups, is something I am totally for.
“The question is what is that going to be, how do we look at it, how does that affect other things like qualification processes and tournaments that are already there? That is the process that we need to go through.”
He added: “We used to have something in between the World Cups, which was the old Confederations Cup.
“It wasn't a tournament that everyone was turned on to but for some confederations it was a nice link between your regional competition and an international competition and we lost that.
“Four or five years ago we had discussions over a 'Global Nations League’ so these discussions are not foreign to the table.
“They might look different, whether it is a Global Nations League, a Confederations Cup or Arsene's idea of a biennial World Cup, these are events that occur in between the current World Cup cycles.”"

LUSAIL, Qatar (AP) — Kylian Mbappé scored a hat trick seemingly from out of nowhere to electrify the World Cup final, he ended the tournament as the leading scorer with eight goals, and he still missed out on winning a second straight title.
The France superstar was on the losing side of an epic final against Argentina that was settled in a penalty shootout after a 3-3 draw on Sunday. He was then consoled on the field by French President Emmanuel Macron.
“Kylian has really left his mark on this final,” France coach Didier Deschamps said.
Mbappé had been the leader France desperately needed as time was running out with the defending champions trailing 2-0 and playing poorly. The forward had also been almost invisible up to that point.
But his goals carried France back into the match — twice. First, late in regulation time. Then again deep in extra time.
Mbappé converted a penalty in the 80th minute and then scored with a volley from just inside the area in the 81st.
It took only 97 seconds for him to get France even with Argentina and the great Lionel Messi.
Mbappé scored a second penalty in extra time, about 10 minutes after Messi had given Argentina the lead again in what became a compelling duel between the two players.
Mbappé’s hat trick was only the second in a World Cup final — the other was by England striker Geoff Hurst in 1966.
The Frenchman leaves Qatar with the Golden Boot trophy as the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals. At the age of 23, he’s matched Pelé’s career total of 12 World Cup goals.
But Mbappé couldn’t quite match the Brazil great’s back-to-back World Cup titles — both players were teenagers when they won their first one, Pelé in 1958 and Mbappé in 2018.
One minute before Mbappé turned the game on its head, Argentina’s fans began to taunt him.
Chants of “Olé, Olé” rained down from the stands at Lusail Stadium as Mbappé futilely chased the ball while his opponents passed it over and around him.
Mbappé gestured in frustration with his right arm at the apparent hopelessness of the situation.
But after scoring his first two goals, Mbappé surged into the Argentina half looking for a game-winning third. His darting, twisting run resulted in a shot deflected just too high.
Once he eventually got the hat trick to make it 3-3 in extra time, Mbappé set out for a fourth. His curling cross barely eluded the head of substitute Randal Kolo Muani, and a final dribble deep into the Argentina penalty area was scrambled clear as he looked to shoot.
He shouted out loud as his last attempt to win the game single-handedly slipped away.
Mbappé tried to set the tone in the penalty shootout, taking responsibility for the first kick. He converted the penalty but France still ended up losing 4-2. Messi did the same for Argentina to start the shootout, but his teammates all scored their penalties.
During the shootout, Mbappé made sure he was the first to console Kingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni on their slow walks back to the center circle after their failures to score.
Mbappé stood bent over in the center circle, hands on his knees, as Argentina defender Gonzalo Montiel prepared to take the decisive kick. He then squatted, saw the net ripple and walked away alone amid the Argentina celebrations.
Deschamps eventually came over behind his player to put arms around his neck. Mbappé soon went to the team dugout and sat slumped in a chair with his dark blue shirt pulled up over his face to hide his emotions.
Long after the game was over, Mbappé left the stadium with his head bowed and the World Cup trophy securely in the hands of Messi.

Founded in 1904 to provide unity among national soccer associations, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) boasts 209 members, rivaling that of the United Nations, and is arguably the most prestigious sports organization in the world.
FIFA was established on May 21, 1904, by seven national associations — Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland — to “promote the game of Association Football (as opposed to rugby or American football), to foster friendly relations among National Associations, Confederations, and their officials and players, by promoting the organization of football matches at all levels, and to control every type of association football by taking steps as shall be deemed necessary or advisable.”
FIFA’s birth was a result of the growing number of international games shortly after the dawn of the 20th century. Soccer leaders in Europe felt that such expanded competition required a governing body, and under the leadership of Robert Guerin, a French journalist, the seven founding members gathered in Paris to shape the future of the sport. Guerin, FIFA’s first president, presided over the organization from 1904 to 1906. Seven other men have also served as FIFA president, including Jules Rimet for 33 years from 1921 to 1954.
Currently, Italy’s Gianni Infantino serves as FIFA president, having been elected in 2016’s Extraordinary Congress held in the wake of corruption allegations against numerous FIFA Officials that resulted in former president Joseph “Sepp” Blatter stepping aside and then being banned from FIFA by its Ethics Committee. FIFA’s general secretary since 2009, Infantino will serve a three-year term as FIFA president.
Under FIFA’s governance soccer has become the world’s most popular sport. According to the Federation’s 2006 “Big Count,” the game is played by more than 150 million registered athletes — including 10 million women — and viewed by billions of fans in stadiums and on television worldwide. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil was broadcast in more than 200 countries. Inside the stadiums, a total of 3,429,873 spectators attended the 64 matches – an average of 53,592 per match – the second highest aggregate attendance behind USA 1994 (68,991).
As soccer’s ultimate administrative authority, FIFA governs all facets of the game: regulating the rules of play, overseeing the transfers of players internationally, organizing international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, establishing standards for refereeing, coaching and sports medicine, and encouraging soccer’s development around the world.
Among the official world championships staged by FIFA are the World Cup, the Women’s World Cup, the Under-20 World Cup, the Under-20 Women’s World Cup, the Under-17 World Cup, the Under-17 Women’s World Cup, the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and the Futsal World Cup. Additionally, FIFA oversees the men’s and women’s Olympic Football Tournament staged under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee every four years. FIFA has also staged the FIFA Confederations Cup, a competition between each of its confederations' champions, and the FIFA Club World Cup, which was held at the beginning of 2000 for the first time in Brazil

The 86-year-old monarch ""orders that tomorrow, Wednesday, be a holiday for all employees in the public and private sectors, as well as male and female students at all educational levels"", the Al-Ekhbariya channel said on Twitter.
The move comes in the middle of final exams in the Gulf nation, indicating that they will have to be rescheduled.
The Saudi Green Falcons bounced back from conceding an early Lionel Messi penalty to produce one of the greatest World Cup shocks thanks to a Saleh Al-Shehri equaliser and a sublime Salem Al-Dawsari winner at the Lusail Stadium in Doha.
Celebrations in Riyadh
Celebrations erupted throughout the capital Riyadh after the final whistle blew, with fans forming impromptu dance circles and waving the sword-emblazoned national flag from the windows of speeding cars.
Al-Ekhbariya posted pictures of King Salman's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, celebrating after watching the game with a group that included energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.
Turki al-Sheikh, an adviser at the Royal Court and head of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, announced on Twitter that admission fees would be waived at major theme parks and entertainment centres in Riyadh on Tuesday.
Few could have predicted that Herve Renard's Green Falcons, ranked 51st in the world, would topple the twice-world champions led by the feted Messi, who has seven Ballons d'Or to his name.
The team's next match is on Saturday against Poland."

Portuguese soccer star Pepe became the oldest player to ever score in the knockout stage of the World Cup Tuesday after his goal against Switzerland—the latest in a series of records and tournament firsts happening in Qatar.
Key Facts
Pepe, who will turn 40 in February, scored with a header off a corner kick in the first of half of the match, bringing the score to 2-0 at halftime.
Meanwhile, England’s 19-year-old Jude Bellingham became the first player born in the 21st century to score a goal in a World Cup match, during his team’s group stage match against Iran.
The Qatar tournament also features the first set of full siblings to compete for different teams, with Iñaki Williams representing Ghana and his younger brother, Nico Williams, making his World Cup debut for Spain (the Williams brothers were born in Spain to a Ghanaian father and Liberian mother, and Iñaki previously played for Spain).
French soccer referee Stéphanie Frappart led the first all-female refereeing trio in a men’s World Cup match last week, joined by assistants Neuza Back from Brazil and Karen Diaz from Mexico to officiate the match between Costa Rica and Germany on Thursday, FIFA announced this week.
Canadian coach John Herdman is the first manager in World Cup history to have led both a men's and a women's team at the tournaments, having previously coached the New Zealand women’s team in the 2007 and 2011 women’s World Cups.
When Qatar lost to Ecuador earlier this month, it was the first time in World Cup history that a host team lost its opening match.
Key Background
The Qatar World Cup is the first ever held in the Middle East, and the most expensive in the tournament’s history, with Qatar spending an estimated $220 billion over the past decade to prepare, including constructing seven new stadiums in which to hold matches. Because of the hot Qatari climate, the tournament is also the first to be held in winter instead of the usual summer schedule, which has disrupted club lineups in other countries. FIFA’s decision to hold the World Cup in Qatar has drawn controversy due to the country’s human rights record, and after scores of migrant workers died while working on World Cup-related construction projects. Qatar and FIFA officials have also been accused of bribery and corruption in voting to hold the tournament in the country.

 Egypt lose on penalties again as Senegal reach World Cup 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hatem Maher  , Tuesday 29 Mar 2022 
 Egypt were once again haunted by a shootout against Senegal, losing 3-1 on penalties following a 1-1 aggregate draw on Tuesday to miss out on a World Cup spot as the reigning African champions pipped them to a place in Qatar.  
 
 Senegal players celebrate a goal scored by teammate Idrissa Gana Gueye, during the World Cup 2022 - Africa playoff soccer match between Senegal and Egypt at at Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade stadium in Dakar, Senegal, Tuesday, March 29, 2022. AP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sadio Mane, just like he did in last month's Nations Cup final in Cameroon, converted the winning penalty with a powerful shot down the middle to spark jubilant scenes at the new 50,000-seater Abdoulaye Wade Stadium near the capital Dakar.

 Egypt's spot-kick specialists Mohamed Salah and Ahmed Zizo astonishingly missed the team's first two efforts, failing to capitalize on equally opening misses from Senegal's Kalidou Koulibaly and Saliou Ciss. 
 Another wasted kick from Egypt striker Mostafa Mohamed, who saw his tame shot come off the outstretched legs of Edouard Mendy, condemned the Pharaohs to a cruel loss as they failed to make back-to-back World Cup appearances for the first time. 
 Several Egypt players wept following the final whistle, with Mane upstaging the subdued Salah once again in another eye-catching duel between the Liverpool teammates. 
 In a scenario similar to Egypt's 1-0 first-leg win in Cairo, striker Boulaye Dia bundled home the opener from four yards out early on after a free-kick was met with a half-hearted defensive clearance. 
 A physical game then unfolded, with both sides struggling to string passes together in a first half low on quality. 
 Egypt vastly improved after the break, threatening on several occasions although Senegal's Ismaila Sarr also spurned a glorious chance for the hosts. 
 Senegal were in control in extra time as Egypt were indebted to goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shennawi for denying some near-certain goals, with Mane and Sarr wreaking havoc down both flanks. 
 Early goal  
 After Ciss's early own goal gave Egypt a first-leg advantage on Friday, it was Senegal's turn to also find the net after four minutes as the passionate home fans, who occasionally threw bottles onto the pitch, were in delirium. 
 A free-kick was floated to the far post, where a poor headed clearance by left-back Ahmed Fattouh fell to Villarreal striker Dia to drill home off El-Shennawi from close range. 
 It was then a scrappy and tense affair as too many fouls and some flying tackles disrupted the flow of the game and cost Egypt two substitutions, with central defender Rabia making way for Ahly teammate Ayman Ashraf and right-back Omar Gaber replaced for natural central midfielder Emam Ashour. 
 Egypt's long balls were easily dealt with by Senegal's rearguard, which had a torrid time in the second half nevertheless. 
 A triple substitution paid off as Egypt were reinvigorated, with Zamalek winger Zizo in particular unsettling Senegal's defence with his pace and trickery. 
 Egypt had three chances to sucker-punch Senegal, who were on the back foot for most of the second half. 
 On 51 minutes, Mahmoud Trezeguet was foiled by Chelsea keeper Mendy on the left hand side of the area after a threaded pass from Salah while Zizo could have scored with his first effort after coming on, leaping above his marker and heading just wide following an inswinging cross from Salah on 71 minutes. 
 Zizo threatened again a few minutes later after cutting inside from the left, his low shot narrowly missing the target. 
 But the second half's best chance came at the other end, with Sarr missing a sitter eight minutes from time when he broke clear and beat the offside trap following a defence-splitting pass from Mane, only to drag his shot wide with the goal at his mercy. 
 Senegal then pinned Egypt into their own half in the first half of extra time and could have settled the tie in their favour had it not been for El-Shennawi. 
 The towering Ahly goalie tipped over a header from Pape Abou Cisse and made a superb reflex save to thwart a goal-bound shot from Sarr after Mane had found them unmarked with a couple of inviting crosses. 
 The shootout marked a fitting end, with Salah blasting his effort high over and Mane stealing the show with a composed kick.

https://olympics.com/en/news/fifa-world-cup-2022-qualified-football-teams-list,"A total of 32 teams have qualified for the 2022 football World Cup, which starts in November.
The FIFA World Cup 2022 is set to be hosted in Qatar in November this year.
Over 200 countries from across the world attempted to qualify in the quadrennial football event but only 32 teams, including hosts Qatar, made the cut the 2022 football World Cup.
Here, we look at all the teams that will be a part of the FIFA World Cup 2022, which starts from November 21, 2022.
A total of 32 teams have qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2022, with Qatar earning automatic qualification, courtesy of being the hosts.
Five-time champions Brazil were the first team from South America to qualify for the event, while Germany were the first European nation to confirm their spot for the Qatar World Cup.
Brazil, who last won the FIFA World Cup in 2002, advanced through the CONMEBOL’s qualification tournament, which includes nine other teams. The Selecao have featured in every World Cup to date.
Lionel Messi’s Argentina, who won the Copa America last year, have also made it through.
Meanwhile, in Europe, Denmark, France, Belgium, Croatia, England, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland and Wales are the teams that will be joining Germany at the World Cup after topping their respective groups in the first round of qualifiers.
However, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal missed the direct spot after being stunned by Serbia in the final group match but qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2022 through the playoffs. Four-time champions Italy, though, failed to qualify after losing to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-finals.
In all, 13 teams from Europe qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2022.
On the other hand, six teams from Asia, five from Africa, four each from North America and South America made it to the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. No team made it from the Oceania region.
Wales qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 64 years after they defeated Ukraine 1-0 in the the intercontinental playoffs. Costa Rica booked the last spot after they beat New Zealand in June.

https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/fifa-world-cup/news/why-didnt-breel-embolo-celebrate-after-goal-scoring-against-cameroon/article66178333.ece,"Breel Embolo scored in the 48th minute to give Switzerland a 1-0 lead against Cameroon in its Group H clash in the ongoing FIFA World Cup at the Al Janoub stadium.
Embolo did not celebrate after his goal and the reason behind his muted celebrations is because he is a Cameroon national by birth. After his parents separated when he was five, he moved to France with his mother and eventually shifted to Switzerland the following year.
Cameroon vs Switzerland LIVE updates
Embolo, in 2014, became a naturalised Swiss national and made his professional debut for Swiss Super League club FC Basel that year.
The 25-year old then moved to German club Schalke 04 in 2016 and went on to play for Borussia Monchengladbach in 2019 on a four-year contract. In the 132 appearances he made in Bundesliga, he scored 28 goals and turned provider for 29 goals. “I’m probably 60 or 70 per cent Swiss now, even more so than I’m African.” said Embolo in an interview to Bundesliga last year.
Embolo currently plays for Monoco in Ligue 1 and has scored eight goals in 23 appearances in all competitions this season. He also has four assists towards his name."

Portugal, which thrashed Switzerland 6-1 in their Round of 16 match, did not include Ronaldo after coach Fernando Santos decided to bench the player. The move was made after Santos learned about Ronaldo's fit after being called to the bench to be substituted.
Portugal started brightly without Ronaldo and annihilated the Swiss team in a game that resembled match practice. Ronaldo himself entered the field in the second half but did not add to his tally in this year's FIFA World Cup.
When asked about Ronaldo's role following his benching for the Round of 16 game, Santos said it was still being defined.
In a press conference, Santos said, ""That is still something that has to be defined. I have a very close relationship with him - I always have, I have known him since he was 19 years old.”
""This relationship only develops, Ronaldo and I never interpret the human aspect of that of manager and player (in relation to) what we have to do during the match. I will always consider in my role that he is an important player to have in the team,"" the coach added.
When asked if he would start against a determined Morocco in the competition's quarterfinal, Santos gave the impression that the player might sit out the contest.
""Ronaldo will definitely (be involved), all the players on the bench can be used, if they are not in the starting line-up they can play later. It is important to look at the example of this player's history, he is one of the best players in the world at playing professionally, being captain - all we have to do is think about this team collectively,"" Santos concluded.
Ronaldo came off the bench in the second half to replace Joao Felix as Portugal defeated Switzerland 6-1 at the Lusail Stadium in the round of 16.
Georgina Rodriguez, Ronaldo's stunning partner, broke her silence on social media after the 37-year-old Portugal captain was dropped for the match against Switzerland.
Georgina chastised Portugal's manager in an Instagram post for not allowing Ronaldo to play for 90 minutes. ""Portugal 🇵🇹♥️💚 While the 11 players sang the anthem all goals placed on you. What a shame he didn't get to enjoy the best player in the world for the 90 minutes. The fans haven't stopped claiming you and screaming your name.""
""I hope God and your dear friend Fernando hold hands and make us vibrate one more night,"" her post read.

But the forward was ruled out of the Qatar 2022 with a thigh injury, which he sustained during a pre-tournament training camp.
France coach Didier Deschamps then decided not to replace Benzema in his World Cup squad, leaving the reigning champions with 25 players for their title defence.
Though there were reports that Benzema might make a comeback into the team’s World Cup plans after making a dramatic recovery, as suggested by reports from France, he was later spotted holidaying at the Indian Ocean island of Reunion.
When asked about Benzema, who is still officially part of the France squad at the World Cup, Deschamps dismissed the question.
“You are fishing for things there, but these things are not on my mind. I don’t know who is saying what, where or how,” the France coach said at a press conference in Doha ahead of Wednesday’s final group game against Tunisia.
“I spoke to Karim after his departure, and you know what his situation is and how long he will be out for. I am focusing on the 24 players who are here. I’ll let you talk about that and debate it if you want, but I am not going to talk about things that don’t affect what we are doing here from day to day.”
Benzema returned to the national side for last year’s European Championship, after having missed France’s title-run in 2018, following a disciplinary issue

Morocco vs Portugal Live score: A extraordinary result
Ronaldo has stormed off the pitch, he seemed to breaking out into tears even before he reached the touchline. This is surely the last time we see him in the World Cup or, indeed, in a Portugal shirt.

Morocco become the first African team to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. Portugal are out. Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva, Pepe, Ruben Neves, Diogo Dalot; all knocked out. It is Morocco, the extraordinary Morocco who have still not let an opposition score against them in this World Cup, who reach the semi-finals. Ghana had come within inches of the semis spot back in 2010 but couldn't quite break the glass ceiling for African nations. Now, Morocco have broken it and how. The teams that have failed to beat them are as follows: 2018 runners-up Croatia (0-0), FIFA World No.2 Belgium (lose 2-0), new boys Canada (lose 2-1), 2010 champions and footbal royalty Spain (0-0, lose on penalties) and now 2016 European champions Portugal.

However, instead of looping it in, Fernandes sends it along the ground to Silva who seems to be caught out by the pace of the pass. He reaches out with his leg and the ball goes wide of the far post. Silva was in all kinds of space there and that would have been a goal had he managed to control it.

FIFA World Cup live score: The Moroccan goal
That was a mix of an excellent jump from En-Nesyri and some weak goalkeeping from Diogo Costa. Yahiya Attiyat Allah, who has been a real nuisance for the Portuguese defence, sent a cross into the Portuguese area. Costa caught in two minds for a second and so he is late to arrive while trying to fist the ball out. En-Nesyri beats him in the air and heads it into the now unguarded goal.

Portugal started off with a thrilling 3-2 win over Ghana and then a rather straightforward 2-0 win over Uruguay. Those two results pretty much confirmed their passage into the knockouts, so much that even a stunning 2-1 loss to South Korea could not knock them out. Then they gave Switzerland a 6-1 hiding in the round of 16 and here they now are, looking to unlock the Moroccan puzzle.

Hundreds of them have flown into Doha for the match after Royal Air Maroc laid on seven extra flights, joining a large contingent already present in Qatar, where many Moroccans live and work.

Portugal vs Morocco Live score: Combative Santos
Fernando Santos was pretty assertive when stating that rumours of Ronaldo wanting to leave the World Cup after being told that he won't be starting against South Korea were false. ""He has never told me that he wanted to leave the team. I think it's high time we stopped this conversation,"" Santos said. “An example of what I just said is what he did in the match. He started warming up with the players, he warmed up with colleagues and celebrated all goals scored. At the end he invited colleagues to thank fans. It's high time for you to leave Ronaldo alone for what he has done for Portuguese football.”

Morocco vs Portugal Live score: Hello and welcome!
Ronaldo is on the bench again but that may not be much of a surprise considering how Portugal played without him in the last match and what his replacement Goncalo Ramos did. The Benfica youngster scored a hat-trick in what was his first-ever major tournament for Portugal. Ronaldo seems to have made piece with the fact that his age may not allow him to be a starter in the national side, stating that he would be more than happy if the team wins the World Cup with him not scoring a single goal for them here on out."
https://dohanews.co/feeling-depressed-here-is-how-you-can-cope-with-post-world-cup-blues/,"Post-World Cup depression is a common psychological condition among many football enthusiasts and athletes, which is used to describe the psychological void experienced by fans following the end of a major tournament.
Feeling frustrated? Irritated? Losing interest in things what used to make you happy? It could be post-World Cup sadness.
The World Cup in Qatar was joyful while it lasted, but after a month of celebrations, Qatar residents are now faced with the overwhelming question of: how do you move on without the World Cup?
Whether you are a football fan or not, for Doha residents the past ten years have primarily revolved around the World Cup.
Many monuments were built for the major event that did not exist before, from the construction of stadiums to Lusail city. Now that the tournament is over, it is hard to imagine life without the 1.4 million fans who flocked to the streets of Doha a few weeks ago.
“Before the World Cup, there were limited things to do in Qatar,” Maryam, a therapist at Hamad Hospital told Doha News.
“This event made people try to go to different shows, concerts, etc. It was not just football. It was fashion shows. It was concerts nearly every single day. Food stalls. Meeting new cultures every day. When that’s taken away from you suddenly, people will obviously react in a sad way,” she said, explaining why post-World Cup sadness is common after major events.
By definition, post-World Cup depression or post-tournament depression is a term that has recently gained popularity, describing the state of mind experienced by fans following the conclusion of the World Cup, which some compare to the feelings of returning to work after a long vacation.
According to experts, some of the symptoms that might occur are similar to mild symptoms of depression, which include moodiness, sadness and laziness, in which one may also find themselves avoiding work and tending to spend all their time at home surfing the internet or avoiding people.
“Post-World Cup depression is not the same as clinical depression, which is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest that can go on for six months and above,” Maryam explained; adding that although post-World Cup sadness might develop into severe depression over time, this is generally a seasonal condition when people are trying to cope and transition after a major event.
If you’re a football fan, you probably developed a routine in which you planned your day around the games. However, now that the World Cup has ended, many people are left with nothing to do or look forward to.
How to cope with post-World Cup depression
According to Trish Bedford, an art-psychotherapist based in Qatar, the first step is to acknowledge that post-World Cup depression is temporary unless you have pre-existing mental health conditions.
“For people who already had mental health issues like anxiety and severe depression before the World began, post-World cup sadness or depression is likely to affect them even more due to different reasons and should seek mental health support,” she explained.
“But if you are feeling sad suddenly because your team lost the World Cup or because you are just struggling to go back to a routine after the end of the tournament, then the process is different,” she said.
When a team you support during a tournament score a goal, your brain releases a chemical called dopamine. The routine of watching high-intensity sports over a significant period of time makes your body get used to high dopamine levels, which can make you feel happy and excited.
The imminent boredom that follows the end of the tournament decreases dopamine levels, causing depressing feelings including tiredness, mood swings, lack of motivation to do daily tasks and other common symptoms, Bedford explained.
“I would recommend doing activities that can increase dopamine or make you feel happy, to avoid falling into a huge depressive episode after,” she said.
Some of activities that can increase your dopamine include, but are not limited to:
- Depending on what you like can include: watching movies or going out with friends. This will allow you to have something to look forward to.
- Create meaning in your life by planning and adopting a routine. Start with what you can do within a day, give yourself little treats or rewards after accomplishing something on your plan.
- Journal or write down how you feel.
- Try to relive some of the World Cup moments with your friends and family, depending on what you can tolerate. This includes going through photos and videos you took and creating a memory board, compiled titktok, etc. This allows you to have closure.
- Listen to your body and mind. Do you need need physical rest? If you are tired and exhausted, it is important to be kind to yourself and take the time your need.

https://olympics.com/en/news/cristiano-ronaldo-number-jersey-squad-football,"Sir Alex Ferguson convinced Ronaldo to wear the No. 7 shirt after his move to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon.
Over the years, several greats; Eric Cantona, George Best and Garrincha to name a few; have graced the No. 7 jersey in football. While each left a mark, none are as synonymous with the iconic number as Cristiano Ronaldo.
Doting fans commonly refer to the Portuguese superstar as CR7, which today is nothing short of a global megabrand. Interestingly, Cristiano Ronaldo also owns the CR7 trademark and runs a luxury menswear brand under the banner.
But how did Cristiano become associated with the number 7? Here’s the full story.
Why is the number 7 jersey coveted
In many cultures around the world, the number seven is considered lucky. So, in many fronts of life, including sports, any involvement with the number is highly sought-after.
More often than not, the best or most talented players get their pick of jersey numbers, which has had a cascading effect on the myth of the No. 7 jersey in due time. Watching great players don the No. 7 on the field has only made the number more desirable for future generations.
Cristiano Ronaldo’s first jersey number was No. 28, given to him after he broke into the Sporting Lisbon first team from the youth setup in 2002.
In fact, it was in his jersey No. 28 that Ronaldo turned up for Sporting Lisbon in a pre-season friendly against Manchester United on August 6, 2003. The friendly match was organised to mark the opening of the Estadio Jose Alvalade - Sporting’s new and current home ground.
Ronaldo, at the time just 18, tormented the famous Manchester United defence in the match. Such was the youngster’s impact in the contest, that Man Utd players thronged Sir Alex Ferguson, the then United manager, and David Gill, then the chief executive, in the team bus and demanded that Cristiano Ronaldo be brought to Old Trafford.
A week later, Ronaldo was a Manchester United player.
As fate would have it, English superstar David Beckham, who used to occupy United’s No. 7 jersey before Ronaldo, had left the club for Real Madrid earlier in the same summer transfer window.
Manchester United’s iconic No. 7 jersey, worn over the years by club legends like Bryan Robson, George Best and Eric Cantona, was lying vacant and Sir Alex Ferguson deemed Ronaldo fit to take up the mantle.
Cristiano Ronaldo, still barely a teenager at the time, was initially unsure if he was ready to take up such a huge responsibility. Taking over the shirt from Beckham, a Manchester local boy and cult hero, was, after all, a monumental task.
But moved by Sir Alex’s confidence in him, Ronaldo accepted the iconic number. Ronaldo made his Manchester United debut wearing the No. 7 jersey number after coming on as a substitute against Bolton Wanderers in United’s 2003-04 Premier League season opener at Old Trafford. The rest, as they say, is history.
Over his next six seasons at Manchester, Cristiano Ronaldo made the No. 7 shirt his own, helping the Red Devils win the Premier League thrice and the UEFA Champions League once. He also won the Ballon d’Or, the first of his five, in 2008.
Temporary No. 9 jersey in Real Madrid
By the time Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid, his childhood dream club, in 2009, he was already one of the best players in the world.
Despite his reputation, though, Cristiano Ronaldo couldn’t retain the No. 7 jersey after his move to Real Madrid as at the time, it belonged to Raul Gonzalez, a true Madrid local boy and cult hero at the Santiago Bernabeu.
Raul, who was also lovingly called El Capitan for captaining both Real and the Spanish national team for years, however, would end up moving on from his boyhood club the next year, allowing Ronaldo to reclaim his beloved No. 7 jersey.
In his nine seasons with the Spanish giants, eight with the No. 7 on his back, Ronaldo would go on to score over 450 goals for Real Madrid, becoming the legendary club’s all-time top goal scorer. Incidentally, CR7 broke Raul’s record (323 goals) on his way to the top.
Ronaldo won two La Liga titles and a whopping four UEFA Champions League trophies with Real Madrid before moving to Serie A giants Juventus in 2018.
At the time of his move, Colombia’s Juan Cuadrado wore the No. 7 shirt for the Old Lady but this time, there was no making Ronaldo wait. Cuadrado promptly vacated the shirt for the Portuguese superstar.
Having moved back to Manchester United in 2021, Ronaldo, understandably, retained his No. 7 jersey.
Even before staking his claim on the No. 7 at Manchester United, Ronaldo did don the number briefly while representing the Portugal U-17 national team in 2001-02. He switched to No. 11 after his promotion to the U-21 national setup.
Ronaldo’s senior international debut came in August 2003 against Kazakhstan, coming on for Luis Figo as a half-time substitute. The then 18-year-old wore the No. 17 jersey at the time, with Figo, already a Portuguese legend, occupying the No. 7.
Cristiano Ronaldo first wore the No. 7 shirt for the senior Portugal football team while playing at the Athens 2004 Olympics but had to wait for a few more years, till Figo’s retirement in 2006, before staking claim on the Portugal No. 7 jersey full-time."

FIFA allotted $440 million in prize money for this World Cup, with teams receiving progressively larger sums according to how far they advanced in the competition.
The 2018 FIFA world cup champions France received $38 million in prize money four years ago, making this year's championship the greatest sum of money FIFA has ever awarded. The prize money given to the winning team increased from $8 million in 2002 to $20 million in 2006, a $4 million increase, not even the biggest so far. The World Cup winner today receives an overall sum that is more than five times greater than it was 2 Decades ago, thanks to increasing tournament revenue making sure that such gains have been allocated to winning teams.
The amount of prize money offered for the men's and women's World Cups continues to be drastically different. The overall prize money for the 2022 World Cup is $440 million, but the prize money for the 2023 Women's World Cup is only $60 million, a $380 million difference.

FIFA has doubled the prize money available for the forthcoming Women's World Cup, with only $30m allocated in 2019. However, there is still a sizable disparity.
All eyes will be on Sunday night's FIFA World Cup semi final between Argentina and France at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar. If France wins today's match, it will take home the World Cup for the second time, after defeating Croatia in 2018. However, a victory for Argentina would undoubtedly add a much-needed ruff to Messi's cap. Messi, who is currently regarded as the finest player in the world, will be hoisting the World Cup for the first time. It will also be Argentina's first championship since 1989.
FAQs:
- How many times did Argentina & France win the FIFA world cup title?
France and Argentina both have two FIFA World Cup victories. France won the championship in 1998 and 2018, while Argentina did it in 1978 and 1986.
- How much money will be given to the 3rd & 4th runner up team ?
Croatia, which finished third on the performance table, will receive $27 million. Morocco, who finished fourth, will receive $25 million in prize money.

https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/korean-footballer-cho-gue-sung-goes-viral-for-his-striking-good-looks-and-goals-8296322/,"The FIFA World Cup 2022 match between South Korea and Ghana on Monday prompted an unexpected surge in the popularity of South Korea’s Cho Gue-sung. Despite losing the match against Ghana by 3-2, the 24-year-old managed to steal the limelight, thanks to his striking looks and two goals that he managed to score within the first three minutes of the game. This made him the first-ever Asian player to score two headers in a single World Cup game.
Cho Gue-sung plays the forward position for the South Korean national team and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, a professional football club based in South Korea’s Jeonju. This is his first FIFA World Cup.
Cho Gue-sung has seen a multi-fold increase in his Instagram following after his match against Ghana on Monday. Many people who were unfamiliar with the Korean football team, began referring to Cho Gue-sung as ‘Player no 9’ based on his jersey number.
After the match, Korean journalist Hyunsu Yim Cho retweeted a fancam style video of Cho Gue-sung and predicted, “ Gue-sung about to see a crazy surge in followers on Insta”. It appears that this prediction was right as currently, Cho Gue Sung’s Instagram followers stand at 1.4 million, even though the star player has only 5 posts.

Ecuador
Jump to another team
This is Ecuador’s fourth World Cup and there are hopes they will equal their best performance, reaching the last 16. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Moisés Caicedo
Strengths
Ecuador have a very young team and with that comes speed, energy and adrenaline, with several new talents hoping to make their mark.
Weaknesses
Goalscoring. La Tricolor do not concede a lot but on the other hand they don’t find the net that often themselves either.
Netherlands
Jump to another team
The Dutch arrive in decent shape with Van Gaal set to become the most successful Oranje coach ever win-wise. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Virgil van Dijk
Strengths
The switch to 5-3-2 seems to have worked well, although some players were initially against it, and the form is good, as the Nations League showed.
Weaknesses
Creativity wise they are dependent on De Jong and Depay, both of whom who have suffered from injuries this season.
Qatar
Jump to another team
A historic first World Cup beckons for the hosts but they are in a tough group with Senegal, Netherlands and Ecuador. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Familiarity. Coach Sánchez has been in charge since 2017 and key members of the team have emerged together from the Aspire Academy.
Weaknesses
Physically this is a team that has been outmuscled on a number of occasions. How they cope off the ball will be crucial.
Senegal
Jump to another team
The reigning Afcon champions have great ambitions for the World Cup to end an already good year on a high. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Kalidou Koulibaly
Strengths
Cissé has created a hard-working team and maybe Dia can shoulder some of the responsibility up front with Mané injured.
Weaknesses
Quite a few players have struggled with injuries and/or being out of their club sides and arrive lacking playing time.
England
Jump to another team
Semi-finalists in 2018 – and Euro finalists three years later – Southgate’s side aim to go all the way – but have they peaked? Read the team guide here.
Strengths
In Kane England have one of the most lethal goalscorers around and he is backed up by creative, young talent such as Foden and Saka.
Weaknesses
Southgate has been criticised for being overly cautious and there are real concerns about the defence because of injuries and poor form.
Iran
Jump to another team
This will be Iran’s sixth World Cup and, boosted by a good performance in Russia, their aim is to get out of the group. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The reappointment of Carlos Queiroz means that Team Melli are very unlikely to concede any soft goals. He offers defensive stability.
Weaknesses
The handling of the former coach, Skocic, divided senior players and those feelings could resurface should Iran get off to a bad start.
United States
Jump to another team
USA are back at the World Cup after missing out on Russia but qualifying was anything but plain sailing. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Christian Pulisic
Strengths
Coach Berhalter has injected youth into the squad and the press can be effective, while there is creativity up front with Pulisic, Reyna and Aaronson.
Weaknesses
Centre-back and centre-forward positions are problematic and frequent injuries have prevented Berhalter from playing his best XI.
Wales
Jump to another team
Wales arrive for their first World Cup in 64 years free of expectation but are determined to do more than merely make up the numbers. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
A band of brothers spirit underpins a modest squad decorated with a pair of game-changers in Bale and Ramsey.
Weaknesses
If Joe Allen is not fit, they could lack nous in midfield. They also have only one bona fide No 9 in the squad in Moore
Argentina
Jump to another team
Argentina arrive in Qatar in unashamedly good shape having gone 35 games undefeated. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Scaloni has created a team and made Messi smile while playing for his country again. That may take them far.
Weaknesses
Losing Lo Celso to injury is a blow – he is an important player for Argentina – and Romero’s hamstring problems are a worry too.
Mexico
Jump to another team
El Tri have reached the Last 16 in every tournament since 1994 but that record feels under threat now. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Hirving Lozano
Strengths
Mexico should be able to cause opponents real problems on the wings with Vega and Lozano both dangerous and hard-working.
Weaknesses
Psychologically they seem to fall apart as soon as they concede and can be really inconsistent in games.
Poland
Jump to another team
Having qualified Poland have a new target: reaching the knockout round for the first time in 40 years. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Robert Lewandowski
Strengths
Firepower. In Lewandowski Poland have one of the best strikers in the world, with other players capable of scoring too.
Weaknesses
Defensive consistency. This has been lost since Euro 2016 and Poland can concede a lot of goals.
Saudi Arabia
Jump to another team
Renard’s new generation dominated Asian qualifying, but face a tough ask to repeat the achievements of 1994’s groundbreaking squad. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Salem Al-Dawsari
Strengths
They boast the Middle East’s finest player in Al Dawsari, plus a welcome blend of experience and youth. Conceded only 10 goals in 18 qualifiers.
Weaknesses
Goals have dried up and there is no clear favourite to start up top. Expected No 1 Al Owais is short of match practice.
Australia
Jump to another team
Australia have had their hopes of progression from a tough group further tempered by a spate of injuries. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The Socceroos are more than the sum of their parts and, cringeworthy as it may sound, have a collective mentality built to exceed expectations.
Weaknesses
A dearth of problem-solving skills against hard-to-break-down opposition is problematic, as is midfield possession and defensive mobility.
Denmark
Jump to another team
Having reached the semi-finals at the Euros and beaten France twice in the Nations League, Denmark arrive high on confidence. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Christian Eriksen
Strengths
Denmark are a well organised team, defending well as a unit and able to change formation and tactics during the game.
Weaknesses
Some of the forwards are out of form and goals could be a problem. A lot, as always, will depend on Eriksen.
France
Jump to another team
Fourth in the world rankings, this is a squad in flux, not unlike the one that showed promise in 2014. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
France’s attack is their strong point – they have shown themselves capable of scoring nearly at will with a full complement of players.
Weaknesses
Defence: injuries and a loss of form have decimated France’s back line. Pogba and Kanté will be missed in midfield too.
Tunisia
Jump to another team
Tunisia have lost only once since January but the 5-1 defeat against Brazil showed how far up it is to the top sides. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Youssef Msakni
Strengths
The midfield is the team’s strongest area with Ferencvaros’ Laïdouni capable of running the show against most opponents.
Weaknesses
Against better teams they struggle to create chances and are a bit too reliant on 32-year-old captain Msakni.
Costa Rica
Jump to another team
Coach Suárez only arrived in the middle of 2021 but has completely revamped the squad. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The youngsters, such as 18-year-old Bennette, has had a really positive impact while there is stability in defence.
Weaknesses
This Costa Rica team does not score a lot of goals (13 in 14 qualifiers) and at one point Suárez tested too many players.
Germany
Jump to another team
Germany may be one of the giants of world football but they are having a wobble. Semi-finals still a minimum requirement though. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
There are so many good creative midfielders that someone such as Gündogan may not start. Sané and Gnabry offer real threat from the flanks.
Weaknesses
The midfield is vulnerable defensively and there is no world-class central striker. Also, the quality of the full-backs are not at the highest level.
Japan
Jump to another team
Moriyasu has overhauled the squad and brought through a new generation with such little fuss that the public do not give him enough credit. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
With Tomiyasu and Yoshida at the back, plus Endo and Morita anchoring the midfield, this is arguably Japan’s strongest defensive foundation ever.
Weaknesses
Moriyasu gets criticised whomever he picks among the many attacking options but Japan do have an issue finding the right fit at No 9.
Spain
Jump to another team
‘We go for the win from the first minute,’ says Luis Enrique and Spain expect to go far as always. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Gavi and Pedro offer exuberance and energy in midfield and have a certain Busquets by their side to protect them (and the defence).
Weaknesses
Goals are not always that easy to come by and Morata was heavily criticised by fans at the Euros. He is still Spain’s focal point.
Belgium
Jump to another team
There is the sense that this generation of players have peaked and that the bronze from four years ago is as good as it will get. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Kevin De Bruyne
Strengths
There is an abundance of talent in the squad and any team with Courtois and De Bruyne will be expected to go deep into the tournament.
Weaknesses
The defence is ageing and slow and the main goal threat, Lukaku, has been struggling with injuries this season.
Canada
Jump to another team
Back on the biggest stage after a 36-year absence they were the best team in Concacaf qualifying, finishing above Mexico and USA. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Alphonso Davies
Strengths
Players such as Davies, David and Buchanan offer speed and explosiveness in transition. The team spirit is superb too.
Weaknesses
Canada lack experience at this level and do not have the star power in defence they have in other outfield areas.
Croatia
Jump to another team
Reached the final four years ago and have the potential to play even better this time. It is a new team but with the same midfield core. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The classy midfield can dictate games and the new defence looks good. Croatia have a remarkably deep and versatile squad.
Weaknesses
The goalkeepers are unreliable; the defenders inexperienced and there is no established goal-scoring presence up front.
Morocco
Jump to another team
A second consecutive Word Cup for the Atlas Lions, they qualified for Qatar without many of the mainstays from four years ago. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
There is stardust in Hakimi and Ziyech in a hard-working squad with Amrabat offering balance in midfield.
Weaknesses
Coach Regragui has been accused of playing defensive football in the past and has only been able to work with the squad for two and a half months.
Brazil
Jump to another team
One of the favourites, they are ranked the best team in the world and there seems to be harmony in the squad. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Brazil still have Neymar but are no longer Neymar-dependant with Vini Jnr, Richarlison and Raphinha taking some weight off the No 10’s shoulders.
Weaknesses
Tite has said he may play five attacking players, which would leave Casemiro vulnerable, and the defence is not the quickest.
Cameroon
Jump to another team
There is a lack of stars in Cameroon’s squad but that may not be a bad thing. Read the team guide here.
Star player
André-Frank Zambo Anguissa
Strengths
The squad has an impressive mental strength and the FA has worked hard to add players of dual nationality, such as Mbeumo.
Weaknesses
The coaching staff and players have only worked with each other for eight months and form has been patchy.
Serbia
Jump to another team
Every tournament is the same in Serbia: expectations that do not match the reality. However, there may be ground for optimism this time. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Dusan Vlahovic
Strengths
All the attacking players are on the rise and full of confidence. There are no egos and coach Stojkovic gives them freedom to play.
Weaknesses
The defence does not instil a lot of confidence in Serbian fans and one single mistake can lead to a full-blown collapse.
Switzerland
Jump to another team
Yakin has been able to build on Petkovic’s foundation and they stayed in the Nations League top group despite a poor start. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
The generation that won the Under-17 World Cup in 2009 are in their peak years and players such as Akanji and Embolo are in fine form.
Weaknesses
Three of the four goalkeepers have had injury problems and the decision to take only two recognised full-backs could backfire.
Ghana
Jump to another team
This is a young Black Stars team in transition. The quality is there but this World Cup could be either a spectacular failure or a rip-roaring success. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Mohammed Kudus
Strengths
Ghana outsmarted Nigeria in the play-off and have added players of dual nationality since then, especially in defence and on the wings, and look better for it.
Weaknesses
Where will the goals come from? That is the main question for coach Addo. If that is answered, Ghana could go far in Qatar.
Portugal
Jump to another team
Cristiano Ronaldo’s power is on the wane and Fernando Santos has lost some of the credit gained in 2016 but Portugal have never had a stronger squad. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Cristiano Ronaldo
Strengths
Portugal have excellent goalkeepers, some of the best full-backs in the world and quality solutions all over midfield. Oh, and firepower up front.
Weaknesses
Santos does not have an abundance of centre-backs and up front Ronaldo’s struggles and Jota’s injury have cast a cloud over the preparations.
South Korea
Jump to another team
Things were looking good for manager Bento, until Son broke his eye socket. He could still play though. Read the team guide here.
Strengths
Bento’s 4-1-4-1 system worked well in qualifying with a 2-0 win against Iran the highlight.
Weaknesses
Son’s injury the major concern but several key players, such as the two Hwangs and Kwon, have been out of form.
Uruguay
Jump to another team
Uruguay are an unknown quantity but Diego Alonso has a good mix of youth and experience in the squad. Read the team guide here.
Star player
Federico Valverde
Strengths
Alonso has one of the best midfields at the tournament, led by Valverde, while Núñez, Suárez and Cavani are a threat up front.
Weaknesses
There are huge question marks about the defence with the fitness of Godín, Giménez and Araujo uncertain."
https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/fifa-world-cup/news/france-beats-denmark-2-1-champion-curse-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-wc-qualify-round-of-16/article66189062.ece,"France became the first defending World Cup winner to qualify for the round of 16 since Brazil in 2006, in the FIFA World Cup 2022, after it beat Denmark at the Stadium 974 in Qatar, on Saturday.
Two second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe, despite a goal from Denmark’s Andreas Christensen, confirmed its route for the pre-quarterfinals of Qatar 2022.
The first goal came just after the hour-mark, when a pass from Theo Hernandez was carried into the box by Mbappe, who finished with ease past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. But the defining moment of the match came in the 86th minute when Antoine Griezmann’s cross was slotted in by the 23-year-old for his second of the night.
With the goal, the Paris Saint-Germain striker became the joint-highest goalscorer in the FIFA World Cup and also the second-highest goal scorer for France in the World Cups, tied with Zinedine Zidane (both seven goals) and just behind Just Fontaine (13 goals).
The win breaks the ‘champion’s curse’ for the Les Blues, who suffered the wrath of the curse 20 years ago, when it was eliminated in the group stage, after winning the World Cup in 1998.
What is the champion’s curse?
Since 1998, European countries winning the FIFA World Cup have failed to make it through beyond the group stages, starting with France, 14 years ago.
Italy, the FIFA World Cup 2006 winner was knocked out in the 2010 edition of the tournament, while Spain, winning its maiden World Cup in 2010, was eliminated four years later as well.

Germany followed suit with a shock exit in Russia four years ago, after beating Argentina in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. Two late goals by Son Heung-min and Kim Young-gwon stunned the defending World Champion as it retuned empty-handed.
Why is it called the France curse in the World Cup?
It is called the France curse in the World Cup because it started with Les Blues in 1998.
Hence, it was poetic justice for France to break the curse, with Didier Deschamps in charge of the side - a man, who was a member of the squad who was first subject to the curse 14 years ago.
No World Cup champion has been able to defend the coveted World crown since Brazil in 1962. With France looking a dangerous side, with six goals in two matches so far, it will be hopeful to script history in Qatar this time around"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/qatar-heads-for-epic-comedown-after-argentina-v-france-world-cup-final,"Bloomberg UK A weekly deep dive into the biggest economic, financial and political issues facing the UK. The show goes beyond the market moves, with expert analysis and top interviews from the heart of London."
https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/france-names-25-man-squad-for-fifa-world-cup-varane-kimpembe-and-giroud-picked/article66118883.ece,"France coach Didier Deschamps picked central defenders Raphael Varane and Prensel Kimpembe, but left out standout goalkeeper Mike Maignan in a World Cup squad announced Wednesday amid injury concerns.
Deschamps announced his 25-man squad on national television. Defending champion France opens against Australia on November 22, and the squad flies to Qatar next Wednesday.
“We have a huge challenge ahead of us. Nothing is bigger than the World Cup. But I have total faith in my players,” Deschamps said. “You can’t change the physical form players are in. We play on the 22nd, so at least we have one week to prepare.”
Veteran striker Olivier Giroud was selected after some fine performances for AC Milan this season. The 36-year-old striker needs three goals to beat Thierry Henry's national team record of 51.
“I think it’s better for the France team that he’s with us,"" said Deschamps, adding that Giroud remains second choice behind Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema. “He knows his status.”
But Maignan — Giroud's club teammate and the best goalkeeper in Serie A when Milan won the league last season — was left out as he recovers from an ongoing calf injury. The 37-year-old Steve Mandanda takes his place as backup for No. 1 Hugo Lloris.
Varane selected despite hamstring injury
Varane, who has 87 international caps, has not played since sustaining a hamstring injury with Manchester United on October 11. He was a rock in France's defence when it won the 2018 World Cup.
Kimpembe, a PSG defender who has 28 caps, has been hampered by a six-week hamstring injury and a recent Achilles Tendon problem.
“Presnel will be ready (for PSG) on Sunday,” Deschamps said. “Raphael’s injury was a bit longer, but he could also be ready against Australia.”
William Saliba, who has excelled for Premier League leader Arsenal this season, and Bayern Munich's Dayot Upamecano provide good cover in central defense.
Marseille right back Jonathan Clauss was left out but teammate Jordan Veretout got the nod in a midfield lineup that includes Real Madrid pair Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni.
“I saw quite a few World Cups in front of the TV with my family,"" the 22-year-old Tchouameni said. ""So hearing my name in the list bings back memories, and now I’m part of it.""
Additional players allowed
FIFA let teams add three players to the usual squads of 23 because of disruption to football during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some players have looked tense in recent weeks amid the fear of getting injured close to the tournament.
“It hasn’t been the easiest choice. But my fellow coaches have faced the same problems during this period,” Deschamps said. “Players have been getting injured and may still get injured.”
Kante, Pogba unavailable
France is without Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante because of injuries, depriving Deschamps of his two best midfielders from the 2018 World Cup.
The 34-year-old Benzema, who has been dealing with muscle fatigue and a bothersome thigh, will miss his sixth straight start when Madrid hosts Cádiz in the Spanish league on Thursday.
Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said Benzema was not trying to preserve himself for France. Deschamps said he's overplayed.
“He’s played an enormous amount, maybe too much at one point. Karim knows that the World Cup is very important for him,"" Deschamps said. ""He hasn’t refused to play for Real Madrid, he just wasn’t in top form. He'll do everything to be ready for the 22nd.”
Strong attack
Deschamps has an attack packed with pace, skill and power.
PSG star Kylian Mbappe joins Benzema, along with Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Ousmane Dembele (Barcelona), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) and Christopher Nkunku, who is enjoying another fine season with Leipzig.
France lost to Switzerland in the round of 16 at the European Championship last year but bounced back to win the Nations League a few months later.
But Deschamps thinks injury concerns could sharpen the focus.
“French teams are not at their best when they’re in a comfort zone,” he said. “We can’t say that we’re in one now.”
France plays Australia at Al Janoub Stadium, then faces Denmark at Stadium 974 before completing its Group D matches against Tunisia on Nov. 30 at Education City Stadium.
No team has successfully defended its World Cup title since Brazil in 1962.
“You’re not going to sap my morale,"" Deschamps told the television presenter when reminded. ""Reaching the highest level is a difficult thing, staying there is even more difficult.”
France’s 25-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar
Goalkeepers: Alphone Areola (West Ham), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Steve Mandanda (Rennes).

https://www.sportingnews.com/in/soccer/news/fifa-rankings-world-cup-teams-updated-calculated/mxphm9f5h9j81ti9rkhvnqhc,"FIFA rankings are a unique way to measure how national teams compare to each other and can prove important when it comes to tournaments like a World Cup.
Draws for such events are influenced by rankings, with the best teams separated from facing each other in the group stages.
This means nations with lower rankings are often drawn in tougher groups and have an even tougher task to win the overall tournament.
FIFA rankings aren't perfect and have come in for criticism in recent years, but they do provide a solid and reliable overview of a side's general consistency and how they'll likely fair come World Cup time.

FIFA rankings for all 32 World Cup teams
Brazil entered the 2022 World Cup as the world No.1 and have held top spot since March 31 this year when they replaced Belgium, who themselves were top for nearly four years.
Ghana, meanwhile, arrived in Qatar as the lowest-ranked nation with the African side currently 61st.
Italy (6th) are the highest ranked side not to have qualified, and Saudi Arabia, in 51st, caused a sensational upset by beating third-ranked Argentina in their opening game.

Which teams have been world number one?
Only eight nations to date have been crowned world number one.
Germany were top when rankings were first introduced with Brazil eventually replacing them.
From there, Italy, France, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, and Belgium have all also enjoyed stints as world number one.
France and Belgium became the first nations to share top spot when they did so briefly in late 2018.
Does the top-ranked side win the World Cup?
Surprisingly, the team ranked number one going into the World Cup has never won the tournament.
Rankings have only been active since the 1994 World Cup, where Germany went in as leaders only to be replaced by eventual winners Brazil.
In 1998, Brazil were still number one but were beaten 3-0 by France in that year's World Cup final.
France were then top during the 2002 World Cup only for Brazil to bounce back and lift the title.
Brazil were world number one going into the 2006 and 2010 tournaments but Italy and Spain both triumphed on those occasions.
Spain were then top going into 2014 when Germany triumphed, who themselves were number one in 2018 when France took out the title.
This trend has continued in 2022 with Brazil knocked out in the quarterfinals and now likely to lose their number one ranking.
How are FIFA rankings calculated?
FIFA rankings have existed since 1992 and uses a points-scoring system to work out standings.
The method for calculating FIFA rankings was officially changed in August 2018.
This new system works by adding or subtracting points from a team's previous total based on results rather than using an average number of points earned over a certain period.
The number of points added or subtracted is influenced by the calibre of opponent a team faces. For example, beating a team ranked inside the top 10 will result in more points being gained than defeating a side ranked outside the top 20. The expected result of the game will also impact the number of points gained.
Specific games are given more weight too, so winning a World Cup match will result in more points than claiming victory in an international friendly.
Matches decided by penalty shootouts are a factor as well with losing teams given the same points as for a draw, while winners only get points equivalent to half a win.
Losing knockout round matches of final competitions also won't result in teams losing any points.
Here's a calculation example provided by FIFA:
- Team A has 1300 points before the match and wins a continental qualifier against team B that has 1500 points
- For team A the formula is: P=1300+25*(1–(1/(10 exp (-(1300–1500)/600) +1)))
- For team B the formula is: P = 1500 + 25 * (0- (1 / (10 exp (-(1500-1300)/600) + 1)))
- Thus, team A wins 17 points and has P = 1317 points after the match
- Team B loses the same amount of points and thus ends up with 1483 points after the match
FIFA rankings points system
If the above example has you scratching your head, you're not alone. But understanding the points system a bit better should help with that.
The 'importance co-efficient' plays a big part in determining just how many ranking points a team can earn from each fixture and is as follows:
- 5 – friendlies played outside the International Match Calendar windows
- 10 – friendlies played within the International Match Calendar windows
- 15 – UEFA Nations League matches (group stage)
- 25 – UEFA Nations League matches (playoffs and finals), Confederations' final competitions qualifiers, FIFA World Cup qualifiers
- 35 – Confederations' final competitions matches (before quarter-finals)
- 40 – Confederations' final competitions matches (quarter-finals and later)
- 50 – FIFA World Cup matches (before quarter-finals)
- 60 – FIFA World Cup matches (quarter-finals, semi-finals, third place play-off and final)
The result of said match then combines with the expected result to determine what percentage of the above points are awarded.
When are FIFA rankings updated?
FIFA rankings are updated after each recognised international window.
As such, they are generally revised several times a year depending on the FIFA calendar.
This year, rankings will only be updated a total of six times with the final revision of 2022 to be made on December 22 after the World Cup in Qatar has concluded."

LUSAIL, Qatar -- Cameroon's Vincent Aboubakar scored a late winner to hand them a memorable 1-0 win over Brazil on Friday, but it was not enough to see Rigobert Song's side through to the knockout stages of Qatar 2022.
- World Cup 2022: News and features | Schedule | Squads
Brazil dominated much of the match, but Aboubakar's 90th-minute winner ensured Cameroon's World Cup campaign finished on a winning note. He celebrated by taking his shirt off and was subsequently sent off by referee Ismail Elfath, who handed the striker a second yellow card for his celebration following another booking earlier in the match.
With qualification already secured, Brazil manager Tite made nine changes to his side ahead of the match and handed Dani Alves the captaincy, and while they head through as winners of Group G, this was a shock result and not the preparation they wanted ahead of their round-of-16 matchup against South Korea on Monday.

Rapid reaction
1. Cameroon give this World Cup another shock
Tite's much-changed Brazil side gave the fresh starters a wonderful opportunity to give the manager a selection headache ahead of the round of 16. A couple took it, while others let it pass them by.
Regardless of the changes, Brazil's expectations remain the same: they anticipated and demanded a win. In a World Cup of shocks, this was another to add to the list.
The swathes of changes represented Tite reinforcing the faith he has in the whole squad to get the job done here in Qatar. Only third-choice keeper Weverson is yet to get any minutes. But the selection gamble, in the short term at least, didn't pay off.
Of those brought in, it was the Arsenal man Gabriel Martinelli who was Brazil's best player on the field as his trickery caused Cameroon a headache. Twice he managed to slip past his marker to get shots on goal, and it was only the astute positioning of goalkeeper Devis Epassy that kept them out.
There were those who failed to make the most of their opportunity, though. Gabriel Jesus never really managed to fashion a chance -- replaced after 54 minutes by Everton Ribeiro -- but did well in link-up play. On the opposite flank to Martinelli, Antony showed flashes of brilliance in the opening stages but was eventually marked out of the game by the Seattle Sounders' Tolo Nouhou. Rodrygo was one of the more promising players off the bench in Brazil's 1-0 win over Switzerland but was handed some rough justice by the Cameroon defence and didn't manage to trouble the goal.
Their profligacy ended up costing them, while it was a defensive lapse that allowed Aboubakar to head home unmarked late on with Bremer missing his man. That will give Tite cause for concern with South Korea lying in wait and the injured personnel watching on from the stands.
For Brazil, the focus was on those in the stands or unused on the bench as much as on those on the field. Neymar was present in the stadium as he continues recovery from an ankle injury -- the sight of him drew huge cheers from the Brazil fans who packed Lusail Stadium -- while Danilo and Alex Sandro were also there. Given that Alex Telles was forced off injured in the early stages of the second half, Brazil will be hoping Alex Sandro is available for the next phase. The signs are promising there, but the breadth of the squad's reserves in defence was tested here with Marquinhos ending up as a makeshift left-back.
For those who wanted to force their way into the starting lineup, the majority failed to take their chance.
2. Cameroon impress despite group stage exit
Cameroon needed a victory against Brazil and results elsewhere to go their way if they were to progress to the knockout rounds, but despite getting the job done their turbulent World Cup ends at the group stage. Considering they started with a lacklustre 1-0 defeat to Switzerland, then had to cope with the scandal surrounding goalkeeper Andre Onana's departure, the fact that they rallied and were still in with a shout of making the round of 16 heading into the final game was credit to them.
Their heroics against Serbia -- when they came back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 -- gave them the platform to create history against Brazil. They were patient. For so much of the match they had their backs against the wall. Up until Aboubakar's late winner, the closest they came was Bryan Mbeumo's header on the stroke of half-time, which needed a world-class save from Ederson to be kept out.
The script was similar in the second half, as they repelled anything and everything Brazil threw at them. And credit has to go the players and manager for their defensive organisation. Given they were without their two first-choice centre-backs for the game -- both Jean-Charles Castelletto and Nicolas Nkoulou were injured -- the fact they managed to keep out Brazil was a great effort. And in the absence of Onana, Epassy put in a monumental performance in goal. He was sensational in keeping out the Brazilian waves of attack. It all gave Aboubakar his shot at history.
3. Dani Alves makes Brazilian men's World Cup history
The ageless Dani Alves cemented his place in Brazilian football history as he became the oldest men's player to represent his country in a World Cup. He captained the side, and aged 39 years and 210 days, he overtook the previous record held by fellow right-back Djalma Santos, who was 37 back at the 1966 World Cup.
Alves' inclusion in the 26-man squad was questioned. Tite came in for heavy criticism for picking the veteran, given Alves was struggling with a knee injury and is in the twilight of his career. But the manager -- in his own, soft-spoken way -- backed the former Barcelona stalwart, saying full-backs in his system don't necessarily need grass-scorching speed, and the 39-year-old had other qualities that would be invaluable.
The man himself said prematch that he would be happy just playing the tambourine to maintain morale, but he proved against Cameroon that he isn't here merely to make up the numbers. He did well keeping threats from his flank at bay for so much of the match, and given Brazil's injuries at full-back will likely be called upon at some stage against South Korea in the round of 16.

Best and worst performers
BEST: Devis Epassy, Cameroon. The Abha No. 1 was monumental in goal for Cameroon. He stopped anything and everything thrown his way.
WORST: Gabriel Jesus, Brazil. Tricky, this one, but the Arsenal forward failed to put his stamp on the game.
Highlights and notable moments
With Brazil legend Pele in hospital suffering from a respiratory infection, Selecao fans sent the former Santos star their best.
Even Ismail Elfath felt bad having to send off Aboubakar.
After the match: What the players and managers said
Epassy: ""We can be proud of what we did tonight as it showed we can be a top team. We didn't qualify, though, which is why we're not overly happy with tonight.""
Fabinho: ""If you don't kill [the game], the opponent only needs one chance. This is what happened. Thankfully, we finished top of the group. It was not a loss that eliminated us but we can still learn from it. We created a lot but we can't miss so many goals.""
Key stats (provided by ESPN Stats & Information)
- Mbeumo's shot on goal in the third minute of first-half stoppage time was the first shot on goal Brazil have faced this World Cup.
- Aboubakar is the first player to be sent off from a game for excessive celebration in a World Cup match going back to at least 1966.
- Cameroon ended Brazil's World Cup group stage unbeaten streak at 17 games. Prior to Friday, they hadn't lost in this phase of the competition since 1998 when Norway defeated them.

The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. A hat-trick occurs when a player scores three or more goals in a single match and it is considered an achievement, especially while playing at the largest international football tournament in the world. Across the over 800 matches at the 22 tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, 54 hat-tricks have been scored. The first hat-trick was scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States, playing against Paraguay in 1930; the most recent was by Kylian Mbappé of France, playing against Argentina on 18 December 2022. The only World Cup not to have at least one hat-trick scored was the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The record number of hat-tricks in a single World Cup tournament is eight, during the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland.
19 players have scored a hat-trick in the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. Two were playing in their first ever World Cup match, Edmund Conen and Angelo Schiavio, both in 1934, a tournament without a group stage. Geoff Hurst (1966) & Kylian Mbappé (2022) are the only players to have scored a hat-trick in the final. Two players have scored a hat-trick in the second group stage of the World Cup, Paolo Rossi and Zbigniew Boniek, both in 1982.

Notable World Cup hat-tricks[edit]
- This section features records and notable hat-tricks relating to the men's World Cup. For notable hat-tricks at the Women's World Cup, see List of FIFA Women's World Cup hat-tricks#Notable World Cup hat-tricks.
- Bert Patenaude was the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, on 17 July 1930 against Paraguay. However, until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude. In 2006, FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as teammate Tom Florie's goal in the match against Paraguay was re-attributed to him.[1]
- Four players have scored two hat-tricks in World Cup matches: Sándor Kocsis (both 1954); Just Fontaine (both 1958); Gerd Müller (both 1970); and Gabriel Batistuta (1994 and 1998).[2] Batistuta is thus the only person to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record of scoring hat-tricks, both were achieved on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty.[3] Kocsis and Müller scored their hat-tricks in consecutive matches.
- Oleg Salenko is the only player in World Cup history to have scored five goals in a single match. He did this during the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Russia and Cameroon.[4]
- One player has scored a hat-trick on his international début: Guillermo Stábile (1930).[5]
- One player has scored four goals for the losing side: Ernst Wilimowski (5–6, 1938).[6]
- Three other players have scored a hat-trick for the losing side: Josef Hügi (5–7, 1954), Kylian Mbappe (3–3, losing 4–2 on penalties, 2022), and Igor Belanov (3–4, 1986).
- One other player has scored a hat-trick in a game that his side did not win: Cristiano Ronaldo (3–3, 2018)[7]
- There have been three occasions when two hat-tricks have been scored in the same match. Two occurred during the 1938 FIFA World Cup: when Sweden defeated Cuba, Gustav Wetterström and Harry Andersson, both playing for Sweden, scored three goals, with the former completing his in the first half. In the Brazil vs Poland, Leônidas did it for Brazil and Ernst Wilimowski for Poland. One occurred in 1954: when Austria defeated Switzerland, Theodor Wagner and Josef Hügi scored hat-tricks for Austria and Switzerland respectively.
- Two players have scored hat-tricks in World Cup Finals. Geoff Hurst scored three goals for England against West Germany in the 1966 Final.[2][8] This is also the longest hat-trick to be completed — most time between the first and third goals. His first goal came at 18', while the second and third goals were in extra time at 98' and 120'. Kylian Mbappé scored the other World Cup finals' hat-trick in the 2022 FIFA World Cup final for France against Argentina. His goals were scored at the 80th, 81st and 118th minute marks. Two of his goals - 80th and 118th - were successful penalty kicks.
- The quickest hat-trick by a player is Erich Probst, who scored at 4', 21', and 24' in 1954, playing for Austria against Czechoslovakia in the first round.
- The briefest hat-trick to be completed — that is, the shortest time between the first and third goals — is the one by László Kiss in 1982 against El Salvador. He scored at 69', 72', and 76', making the time between his first and third 7 minutes. This is also the only hat-trick scored by a substitute.
- The only players to have scored from three headers in a single match are Tomáš Skuhravý in 1990 and Miroslav Klose in 2002.[2]
- The youngest player to score a hat-trick is Pelé, at 17 years, 244 days.
- The oldest player to score a hat-trick is Cristiano Ronaldo, at 33 years, 130 days.[9]
- Germany (incl. West Germany) holds the record for most hat-tricks scored with 7. Germany also shares with South Korea the record for most hat-tricks conceded with 4.

https://olympics.com/en/news/oldest-goal-scorer-fifa-world-cup-football,"Roger Milla holds the record of being the oldest footballer to score a goal in the FIFA World Cup, having scored at the age of 42 years and 39 days. Know the full list.
Football, especially at the highest levels like the FIFA World Cup, is a young man’s game.
Outfield players in football peak in their late 20s or early 30s. By the time they are in their mid-30s, most are past their prime and consequently, players over 35 are often a rarity on the biggest stage of the game
However, there are an exceptional few, who have defied age and made their mark on the biggest of stages even in their twilight years. Cameroon legend Roger Milla, the oldest goal-scorer in a FIFA World Cup match, and Portugal ace Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently became the third-oldest footballer to score in a World Cup match, are fine examples.
Here are the 10 oldest World Cup goal-scorers in the history of football.
|No.||Player (Country)||Age||Opponent||Edition|
|1||Roger Milla (Cameroon)||42 years, 39 days||Russia||USA 1994|
|2||Pepe (Portugal)||39 years, 283 days||Switzerland||Qatar 2022|
|3||Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)||37 years, 295 days||Ghana||Qatar 2022|
|4||Gunnar Gren (Sweden)||37 years, 236 day||West Germany||Sweden 1958|
|5||Cuauhtemoc Blanco (Mexico)||37 years, 151 days||France||South Africa 2010|
|6||Felipe Baloy (Panama)||37 years, 120 days||England||Russia 2018|

|8||Martin Palermo (Argentina)||36 years, 227 days||Greece||South Africa 2010|

|10||Tom Finney (England)||36 years, 64 days||Soviet Union||Sweden 1958|
Cameroon legend Roger Milla holds the record of being the oldest footballer to score a goal in the men’s FIFA World Cup, having netted against Russia in the 1994 World Cup in the USA at the ripe old age of 42 years and 39 days.
To date, Roger Milla, often dubbed ‘the Old Lion’ by fans, is the only player over 40 years of age to have scored at a World Cup. However, perhaps the story that led up to Milla’s feat is even more fascinating than the record in itself.
Having made his international debut in 1973, Roger Milla retired from international football in 1987 at the age of 35. For 15 years, the striker had enjoyed a fruitful career with the national side and hung up his boots with the reputation as one of the best footballers to have ever come out of Cameroon and Africa.
An Olympian from the Los Angeles 1984 Games, Roger Milla had also represented Cameroon at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain and even got the ball in the net in a match against Peru. Unfortunately, the goal was disallowed and Milla had made peace with the fact that his dream of scoring in a World Cup will remain unrealised.
However, little did Milla know when he retired that his best years were yet to come. The striker was still playing club football after his early international retirement. However, after Cameroon qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, fate came calling.
Paul Biya, the then President of Cameroon, had seen Milla play in a charity match and insisted that he be included in the national team for the showpiece in Italy. Biya went a step further and personally called Roger Milla to make up his mind.
“I got a call from the President who said he thought I should play and I was in no position to argue. I knew that if I got into shape, I could make an impact.” Milla later told Reuters.
Roger Milla scored four goals, all after coming on as a substitute, to lead Cameroon to the quarter-finals of Italy 1990 - the furthest any African team had progressed in the competition at that time. Senegal matched the record in 2002.
Milla didn’t score in his nine-minute cameo against reigning champions Argentina, a match Cameroon famously won with nine men. But Milla scored twice against Romania in a group game before single-handedly dragging the Indomitable Lions to the quarters with a brace against Colombia in the Round of 16.
Incidentally, any of Milla’s goals in the 1990 World Cup would have been enough to make him the oldest-ever scorer in FIFA World Cup history. His extra-time brace against Colombia in the pre-quarterfinals came when he was 38 years and 34 days old - a good 100 days younger than Cristiano Ronaldo, the second-oldest World Cup scorer in history.
However, Roger Milla would return for the 1994 World Cup in the USA and scored Cameroon’s only goal in a 6-1 defeat to Russia. However, his feat in the contest was overshadowed by Oleg Salenko’s five goals, which still stands as the record for most goals scored in a single World Cup match by a player.
Roger Milla is also the oldest outfield player and third-oldest player to have ever taken the field in a football World Cup match. Egypt’s Essam El-Hadary (45 years, 161 days) and Colombia’s Faryd Mondragon (43 years, 3 days), the top two oldest players to have played in a World Cup match, were both goalkeepers.
Pepe became the oldest player to score at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar when he netted one in Portugal’s 6-1 drubbing of Switzerland in the Round of 16. At 39 years and 283 days, Pepe thus became the second-oldest ever to score at the World Cup, eclipsing Cristiano Ronaldo, who had taken the position in the team’s opening game.
Captaining the team against Switzerland, Pepe was the second player to score in the match, handing Portugal a 2-0 lead in the 33rd minute. In the end, however, it was Gonçalo Ramos who starred for Portugal with a hat-trick, the first of Qatar 2022.
Cristiano Ronaldo became the third-oldest World Cup goal-scorer in history after converting from the penalty spot during Portugal’s 3-2 win over Ghana in their Group H opener at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
The Portuguese legend’s penalty kick in the 65th minute was the opening goal of the match and proved vital as the match ended 3-2 in Portugal’s favour.
Incidentally, Russian defender Sergei Ignashevich did score an own goal against Spain in the 2018 World Cup in South Africa at the age of 38 years and 352 days. However, self goals aren’t counted as records.
Before Roger Milla came out of retirement and scored his maiden World Cup goal against Romania in Italy 1990, Sweden’s Gunnar Gren owned the record of the oldest goal-scorer in a football World Cup for over three decades.
Gunnar Gren’s only World Cup goal came against West Germany in the semi-finals, a match Sweden famously won before going down 5-2 to Pele’s Brazil in the final.
Gunnar Gren’s Swedish team-mate Nils Liedholm netted the opening goal in the 1958 final against Brazil, which made him the oldest player to score in a World Cup final. Nils Liedholm was 35 years and 264 days old at the time.
Considered one of the greats of Swedish football, Gunnar Gren played a pivotal role in helping his national team win the gold medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.
Obdulio Varela, who captained Uruguay to the FIFA World Cup title in 1950, and Germany’s Miroslav Klose, the top goal-scorer in World Cup history also features in the top 10 list of oldest scorers in the football World Cup.
Formiga (Brazil) 37 years and 98 days vs South Korea in FIFA Women’s World Cup 2015
Brazil’s Formiga is the oldest goal-scorer in the FIFA Women’s World Cup, having scored in a match against South Korea in her team’s Group E opener vs South Africa in the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2015 in Canada. She was 37 years and 98 days old at the time.
USA legend Megan Rapinoe is the oldest player to have scored in a FIFA Women’s World Cup final. She scored in the 2019 Women’s World Cup final against the Netherlands just two days after her 34th birthday."

Japan shocked all in beating Germany and Spain to reach the last-16 of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - and the stats have laid bare the remarkable nature of their achievement.
Hajime Moriyasu's side upset the odds in beating the two football giants - with five World Cups between them - to finish top of Group E and set up a seemingly winnable last-16 tie with Croatia.
Key to their success was their ability to sit deep, made viable by their impressive backline, and hit the over-exposed sides on the break.
Japan were forced - as they did against Germany - to sit in for large periods and contain
Spain enjoyed lots of the ball and could have wrapped the game up by the break but Japan rode their luck and emerged victorious
Indeed, such was the players' ability to carry out their coach's instructions, Japan broke the record for the lowest amount of possession held by a winning team in any World Cup fixture since 1966.
Their 18 per cent possession of Spain outstripped South Korea's 26 per cent against Germany in 2018 and their own 27 per cent against the same opposition in their Group E opener.
Forced to sit back and contain Spain for much of the first half, Japan trailed at the break thanks to a header from Alvaro Morata, notching his third goal in three games - seemingly ensuring his side finished top of the group.

The Japan players fell to the ground and celebrated wildly after they beat Spain to finish top of Group E
However, coming out for the second half, Moriyasu made his - now - customary changes and Japan emerged out of their shell to leave Spain's players dumbfounded and fearful of their place in the next round.
Ritsu Doan, introduced at half-time alongside Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, got Japan level just after the break with a lashed left-footed effort that was too powerful for Unai Simon in the Spain goal.
With their tails up and knowing Germany were likely to defeat Costa Rica, Japan pressed for another, three minutes after their equaliser they had it through Ao Tanaka . The controversy surrounding their second - was the ball over the line or wasn't it - took away from the astonishing nature of their achievement.
Their policy of containment allowed them to hit an over-exposed Spain side on the break
Needing to protect their lead, Japan retreated back into their customary low block with Shogo Taniguchi, Maya Yoshida and Kou Itakura being joined by Arsenal's Takehiro Tomiyasu to form a solid base which Spain, for all their possession, could not penetrate.
Japan's 27 per cent of the ball against Germany had seemed impressive, but sinking to 18 per cent has left many wondering how low can Japan go with their low block in attempting to keep their opponents at bay.
Spain, meanwhile, were on the receiving end of another shock result that stemmed from a team in essence refusing to hold onto the ball when Switzerland beat them 1-0 at the start of the 2010 World Cup. Ottmar Hitzfeld's side enjoyed just 27.12 per cent of the ball that day.
Saudi Arabia's famous victory over Argentina in Qatar last month completes the five lowest totals, with Herve Renard's side recording just 31 per cent possession.

The event started with American actor Morgan Freeman's dulcet voice and an Arabian theme with camels.
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani arrived at the stadium flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino to a roaring crowd. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was also present at the opening ceremony and inaugural match of the tournament.
The opening show also saw the performance of a new tournament song called ‘Dreamers’ featuring singer Jungkook of K-pop boy band BTS, alongside Qatari singer Fahad Al-Kubaisi. Interestingly, Qatar is also the smallest nation to host soccer's biggest global event. Crowd control will be key with some 1.2 million visitors expected - more than a third of its population.
A ban on sale of beer was imposed two days before the opening ceremony of the World Cup.However, at the FIFA Fan Festival in central Doha, visitors were seen sipping beers. But the conditions outside the city's edges were different as hundreds of workers gathered in a sports arena in an industrial zone, without alcohol.
Thousands of attendees were turned away from a Saturday night concert in the official fan zone because of overcrowding. According to the reports, around 1.2 million visitors are expected to begin arriving this week in the tiny nation on the Arabian Peninsula.
Qatar - which is home to 3 million people, mostly migrant workers - has spent more than $200 billion on improvements across the country for the tournament. Among the additions are seven new purpose-built venues, including the 60,000-seat Al Bayt Stadium that hosted Sunday's opening ceremony and the first match.

Zinedine Zidane in his prime was just pure art. Michel Platini was very much a player in the same mould. Just Fontaine is an absolute World Cup legend.
And then there were clinical attackers such as Jean-Pierre Papin, David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry.
These days, the likes of Karim Benzema, Olivier Giroud, and Kylian Mbappe have taken over the mantle and spend a lot of their time on the pitch celebrating goals.
Giroud has latestly surpassed Thierry Henry as France's all-time leading men's scorer by scoring for Les Bleus in the 2022 FIFA World Cup round of 16 match against Poland.
But who is France's most lethal attacker ever?
Let's take a look at the legends leading their all-time goalscoring charts!"
https://www.goal.com/en-in/news/luis-enrique-spain-1000-penalties-training-world-cup-shootout-heartbreak/blt6882879ff7d633fa,"- Spain practised penalties
- Missed all three against Morocco
- Lost shootout and exit World Cup
WHAT HAPPENED? Spain have been knocked out of the World Cup by Morocco on penalties. The two teams played out a goalless draw which meant spot-kicks were needed to determine the winner. Luis Enrique admitted before the game his side had done plenty of practice, but he could only sit and watch as Carlos Soler, Pablo Sarabia and Sergio Busquets missed all three Spain penalties.
WHAT THEY SAID: ""I imagine that they have done their homework. Over a year ago, in one of the Spain camps, I told them they had to get here with at least 1,000 penalties taken. If you wait until getting here to practise penalties... [it won't be enough],"" he told reporters.
""It's a moment of maximum tension, a time to show your nerve and that you can shoot the penalty in the way you have decided, if you have trained it a thousand times. It says a lot about each player. It's trainable, manageable, how you manage the tension. It's increasingly less luck - the goalkeepers have more influence. We have a very good goalkeeper, any of the three can do very well in this situation. Every time we finish training, I see a lot of players taking penalties.""
THE BIGGER PICTURE: Spain may have done their homework regarding penalties but it certainly didn't pay off in Qatar. Sarabia hit the post with Spain's first spot-kick, while Soler and Busquets were both denied by goalkeeper Yassine Bounou who was the hero for Morocco. Achraf Hakimi then showed Spain exactly how it's done by sealing the win with a cheeky panenka.
IN THREE PHOTOS:GettyGettyGetty
DID YOU KNOW? Spain have become the first nation in World Cup history to lose four penalty shootouts, while they've become just the second side to not score in one after Switzerland against Ukraine in 2006.
WHAT NEXT? Luis Enrique's side will now home after being knocked out of the World Cup. Morocco go on to play either Portugal or Switzerland in the quarter-finals."

Family
Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América, the 2022 Finalissima, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (102). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).
Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.
An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, became the first player to score in every stage of a World Cup (including two in the final), and broke the record for most appearances in World Cup tournaments with 26 matches played.
Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team-sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.
Early life
Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[9] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[4] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, ""Leo"" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[10] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[11] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[12][13]
""When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.""
– Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[14]
A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of ""The Machine of '87"", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[15][16] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[17] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[18][19] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him ""the best forward I've ever seen"".[20]
As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[18][21] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[15][21][22]
After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[23] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[24] Messi became an integral part of the ""Baby Dream Team"", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[23][25] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[26] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[21][27][28]
Club career
Barcelona
2003–2005: Rise to the first team
""It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.""
– Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[29]
During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[30] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[31][32] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: ""He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.""[33]
At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[21][34] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[35] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[36] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called ""little brother"", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[37][38]
To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos.[31][39] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80 million.[31][40] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[41] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[31][39]
During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[36][42] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[36] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[43][44] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.[21] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[38] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[42] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[43][45] Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.[46]
2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player
""In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy' shirt of one of the world's great clubs.""
– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[47]
On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.[40] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[47] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[48] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[49] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[40][50]
Due to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[50][51] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o.[28][52][53] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[54][52] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, ""We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.""[55] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League,[56] in a 5–0 win over Panathinaikos on 2 November 2005,[57] his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.[46][52]
While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[58][59] Already an idol to the culés, the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[59][60] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[61][62] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[63] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[60] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[64] His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.[65]
Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[66] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's second goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66 yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[18][67] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[68] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[69][70]
After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname ""Messiah"" from the Spanish media.[18][71][72] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[73][74] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[75] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[76] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[77] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[76] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[78]
2008–09: First treble
After two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[53] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[79][80] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[62][81] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[73][82]
In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside Eto'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[83][84] During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[85][86] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[87] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[83][88]
As the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[89] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[85] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[90] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[79]
2009–10: First Ballon d'Or
His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[91] After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[92] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[73]
""Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He's [like] a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make.""
– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[93]
The new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16.[94] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club's summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimović occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[95] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[96][97] He scored all of his side's four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in the competition.[98] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year.[99] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[97][100]
2010–2011: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League
Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat.[101] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[102] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[103][104] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[73][105] Under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.[105]
Towards the end of the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in the span of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[106] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[107][108] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory.[109][110] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league's top assist provider with 18.[111][112] He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, becoming Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.[111][113]
As Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[114] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[115][116][117] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals.[118][119] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[120] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[121] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[122] By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[22]
2012: A record-breaking year
""I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's impossible, this kid is unique.""
– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer at the age of 24 in March 2012[123]
As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[124][125] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[126][127] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[128]
Despite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end.[129] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[130][131] In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[132] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[133][134]
Under manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in Spanish football.[135] A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[136] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed ""with respect and admiration"", after breaking his 40-year record.[137] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[138] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[139][140] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[138][141]
2013–2014: Messidependencia
Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health.[142] After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi.[143] Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13 million.[144][145] He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[146] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.[147]
""In Leo we are talking about the best player in the world and when things are not going well you have to use him. Even if he is half lame, his presence on the pitch is enough to lift us and our play in general.""
– Defender Gerard Piqué explains Barcelona's reliance on an unfit Messi against Paris Saint-Germain in April 2013.[148]
After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[149] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[149]
Messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[150] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[151][152] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[153][154] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[155][156] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[157]
During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[158][159] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[158][160] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[159][161] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[162] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[163] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[164] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[165]
2014–15: Second treble
Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[166] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[167] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[168] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[169]
At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed ""MSN"", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[170][171] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[171][172] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[173][174] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[175]
Towards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[176] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[177] As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 3] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[178][179][180] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[181]
In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[182] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[183][184] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[185][186] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[175] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[187][188] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[189]
2015–16: Domestic success
Messi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[190] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[191] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[192] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[193] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[194]
On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[195] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[196] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as ""a touch of genius"", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, ""Barca's forwards are very respectful."" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was ""very happy"" with the play, insisting ""it was legal and entertaining"".[197][198]

August 2020: Desire to leave Barcelona

– Messi on reversing his decision to leave Barcelona in an interview with Goal on 4 September 2020.[285]
Following growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[286] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club ""a document expressing his desire to leave"" on 25 August 2020.[287] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi's statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[288] On 26 August, Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club's desire to ""build a team around the most important player in the world""[289] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi's contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player's representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season.[290] On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi's contract and buyout clause were still active.[291]
On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel's father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause ""is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player's unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season"", as stated in Messi's contract with Barcelona;[292] moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[293] Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[294] This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying ""I would never go to court against the club of my life"".[295]

After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell's Old Boys, in tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both hands to the screen showing Maradona's face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[301] On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men's Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.[302]

After adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in a attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31 July by scoring PSG's first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions, winning his second trophy with PSG.[341]
Due to his previous form last season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d'Or award for the first time since 2005.[342] On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbappé, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1's second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7–1 away win over Lille.[343][344] The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in September.[345] On 5 October, he scored in a 1–1 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition's history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents.[346] On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7–2 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals.[347] Four days later, Messi scored and provided an assist as PSG won 4–3 against Troyes to remain top of the Ligue 1 table.

International career
2004–2005: Success at youth level
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[351] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[352]
Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[353][354] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[354]
2005–2006: Senior and World Cup debuts
In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[355] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[356] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his ""re-debut"" ahead of the match.[357] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as ""a jewel"".[358] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[359] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[360]
During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[361] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[362][363] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[364][365] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[366] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.[367][368]
2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold
As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[59][369] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[370][371] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[369] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[372] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[369] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[373]
Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[374] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[375] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[376] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[377]
2008–2011: Collective decline
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[369] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[359][378] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[379] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[359] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[380]
Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[378] He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[381]
Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[382] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his ""outstanding"" pace and creativity and ""spectacular and efficient"" dribbling, shooting and passing.[383] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[384]
Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[384][385] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[111][359] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[384]
2011–2013: Assuming the captaincy
After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.[386][387] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[359][386]
Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[359][386] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[388] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[359][389] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[386]
2014–2015: World Cup and Copa América finals
Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[390] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[391] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[392] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[393] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[394][395] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[396]
Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[397] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[398] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[390][399] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[400]
Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[401][402] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[403] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[404] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[359][404]
As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[405] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[406] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[405] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[407] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[408] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[409]
2016–2017: Third Copa América final, retirement, and return
Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[410] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[411] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[412] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[413]
""Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, 'he's the top scorer for the Argentina national team.' But the advantage I have is that I'm second to an extraterrestrial.""
– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[414]
On 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[415] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[416] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[417] and was named man of the match once again.[418]
During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[419] He stated, ""I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.""[420] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, ""My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.""[421] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[422] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[423]
Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[424] He was greeted by fans with signs like ""Don't go, Leo"" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, ""We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.""[425] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[426] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[427]
""A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.""
– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[428]
Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[429] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[430] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[431]
On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[432][433] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[434] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[435] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[435]
2018: World Cup
""The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]""
– Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.[436]
Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[437][438] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[439] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[440] In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying ""we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle"".[441] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, ""Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone.""[442]
In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[443] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[444][445] He was awarded Man of the Match.[446] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[447] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[448] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[449][450]
Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[451] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[452] A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire.[453] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[454]
2019–2020: Copa América third-place, suspension and Superclásico victory
On 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni's final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.[455] In Argentina's second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[456] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[457] Following Argentina's 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match,[458][459] and alleged the competition was ""set up"" for Brazil to win.[460]
In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[461] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[462] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[463] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[464] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[465] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[466]
2021–2022: Copa América and World Cup triumphs
""It was clear to me that I had to try until the last tournament and that I couldn't withdraw from the national team without winning something.""
– Messi on winning the 2021 Copa América in an interview with Diario Sport.[467]
On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[468] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[469] A week later, he broke the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[470] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[471] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[472][473] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[474][475] Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament's top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[476][477]
On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[478] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[479] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.[480]
At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[481] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance,[482] and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records.[483][484] In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[485] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[486] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all–time top–scorer at the World Cup.[487] Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[488][489]
In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup finals appearance at Lusail Stadium. Messi scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in each round of a single World Cup edition.[490] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[491] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé.[490] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).[492] The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé.[493][494][495][496] Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying ""I want to continue playing as a champion"".[497]
2023–present: Post World Cup triumph and 100 international goals
Following the World Cup, Messi made his return to Argentina as world champion for two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal from a free-kick in Argentina's 2–0 friendly win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[498] In the following match against Curaçao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, in a 7–0 win. This achievement also marked a new milestone for Messi, as he became the third player to score 100 international goals.[499]
Player profile
Style of play
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[500][501] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (""The Atomic Flea"").[502][503][504] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[15][501][505] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[506] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, ""Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.""[44] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[507][508]
A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[509] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[510][511][512] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[501][513] As of October 2022, Messi ranks 9th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 60,[514] the most among active players.[515] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[516]
Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[505][513][517] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[518] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[519] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, ""The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.""[508] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[500][501]
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[380] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[44] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[22] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[172][520] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[521][522] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[523] or even on the right wing[524] or as a false nine,[525][526] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[522] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[527][528]
As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[529][530][531] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[532] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[385][533]
Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona
""I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.""
– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[66]
A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[59] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, ""I'm not even the best at Barça"", in reference to his protégé.[534][535] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[73] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[11][505][536] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[537] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[113][538] and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[539][540] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[541] until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.[542]
Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the ""New Maradona"" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[19][378] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, ""Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.""[543] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays ""at the level of the best Maradona"".[544] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[545][546][547]
In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[351][548][549] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[15][351] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[384] Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi ""was always seen as more Catalan than one of them"".[550] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: ""Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.""[551] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[552][553][554] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become ""more one of the group, more Argentine"", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[550]
Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo
Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[555][556]
Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[557][558] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[158] Since 2008, Messi has won seven Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[559] six FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[560] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[158][561] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[562][563][564] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[565] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[565]
In popular culture
According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[163][566] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[567] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[568] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[569] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[79][80][144] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus.[570] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[570] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[571]
In addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[572] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[573] Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[565] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[574][575] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[576] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[577]
As a commercial entity, Messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[579][580] From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[579][581] Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[582][583][584][585] Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[586][587]
Messi's global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people as published by Time, in 2011 and 2012.[588][589] His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by August 2021 he had over 103 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[590][591] He also has over 400 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[592] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes.[593] According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[594][595] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a ""tourist attraction"".[596]
Other events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.25 million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[597] In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137 million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[598][599] World Press Photo selected ""The Final Game"", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[600] Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[601]
In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, ""sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.""[602] In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[603][604] In August 2022, Messi was urged by the family of Mohammed al Faraj to intervene on their son's behalf after he was arrested in 2017 at the age of 15 for crimes against the Saudi regime and faced the death penalty.[605]
Personal life
Family and relationships
Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[606] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[607] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[608]
""Leo is not shy. He's introverted. He's reserved.""
— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 4] who addressed Messi's growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.
Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[610] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[611] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[612] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[613] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[614] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.[615]
Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[616]
Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of ""The Machine of '87"" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[15][617][618] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[619] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[620] His favourite meals include asado (traditional South American barbecue), milanesa and pasta, and he prefers his mate unsweetened.[621]
Philanthropy
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[622][623] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[624] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[625]
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[626] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[617] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[617][627] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global ""Messi and Friends"" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[628][629]
Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[617] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[15] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[630] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[631] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[632] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[633]
In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[634][635] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[636]
In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[637] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that ""Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones"".[637]
Tax fraud
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[638] Facing the judge, he said, ""I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.""[639]

Notes
- ^ According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single ""Messi"", in accordance with Argentine customs.[3][4] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double ""Messi Cuccittini"".[5] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: ""The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders.""[6]
- ^ In addition to four FIFA Ballons d'Or, Messi received France Football's Ballon d'Or and FIFA's World Player of the Year award in 2009 prior to their incorporation; both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballons d'Or.[7][8] In 2019, he received a sixth Ballon d'Or and won the Best FIFA Men's Player, before receiving a seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. He was named the Best FIFA Men's Player for the second time in 2022.
- ^ Assist statistics began in 1990.
- ^ According to Bleacher Report's Richard Fitzpatrick, ""Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment.""[609]
- ^ a b Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[650][651] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions.[652]

Cristiano Ronaldo made history Thursday as the first male player to score in five World Cups in Portugal's opening game in Qatar against Ghana.
The Portugal captain scored in the 65th minute from the penalty spot -- the 118th goal for his country -- to open the scoring at Doha's Stadium 974. Portugal went on to win 3-2 as goals from Joao Felix and Rafael Leao helped them weather two late efforts from Ghana.

Ronaldo, 37, is the most prolific goal scorer in men's international football and has made a record 18 appearances for Portugal at a World Cup.
""It's a beautiful moment, in my fifth World Cup. We won, we started off on the right foot, a very important victory,"" Ronaldo said of the milestone. ""We know that in these competitions winning the first game is crucial. Another record too, the only player to score in five consecutive World Cups, that for me it is a reason of great pride.
""I am very happy for the team to have given an excellent performance. Difficult, but fair win.
""The important thing was that the team won. The [Manchester United] chapter is closed, and the focus is solely and exclusively on the World Cup. As I said, we wanted to start off on the right foot. We won, we played well, I helped the team. Everything else is not important. The important thing is the national team.""
His latest landmark comes after he left Manchester United by ""mutual agreement"" earlier this week following an explosive TV interview in which he criticised the club and coach Erik ten Hag.
The forward made his Portugal debut in 2003 and scored his first goal 10 months later during a Euro 2004 group stage game against Greece.
His first World Cup goal, in 2006, was from the penalty spot in a 2-0 win over Iran. His next World Cup goal came four years later in South Africa in a 7-0 rout of North Korea. Ronaldo also scored in Portugal's 2-1 win over Ghana in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but his side faced disappointment as they were eliminated in the group stage.

The first player to score in five World Cups, men's or women's, was Marta in 2019, and Christine Sinclair matched the feat that same year.
Ronaldo's most successful World Cup campaign was in 2018 in Russia, where he scored four goals, including a hat trick in a 3-3 draw with Spain. The last of those goals came in the 88th minute, a 25-yard free-kick that flew into the top left corner past United teammate David de Gea.
Portugal's best performance with Ronaldo was the 2006 World Cup, when they finished fourth.
By scoring in Thursday's Group H game against Ghana, his eighth goal at a World Cup, he is one strike from equalling the country's record in the competition, set by Portugal legend Eusebio. Eusebio helped Portugal reach third place at the 1966 World Cup in London, where he finished as the top scorer with nine goals.
Ronaldo's finest hour in international football came when he captained Portugal to Euro 2016 glory against hosts France with a 1-0 victory. It was Portugal's first major title, and it was followed by UEFA Nations League glory three years later.
Cristiano Ronaldo wrote on Instagram: ""Very important win in our World Cup opener but nothing is won! It was just the first step! We remain focused on the pursuit of our objectives. Strength Portugal!"""

Morocco dumped Spain out of the World Cup in a last-16 penalty shootout on with Spanish-born Achraf Hakimi scoring the decisive spot-kick after Spain squandered all three of their attempts, following a 0-0 draw over 120 minutes. The win took the North African nation to its first-ever quarterfinal.

Hakimi, a product of the Real Madrid youth system, calmly slotted his penalty past Unai Simon in Spain's goal to seal Morocco's 3-0 win in the shootout.
During the 90 minutes plus extra time, Spain dominated possession but failed to create many clear chances against Morocco’s stubborn defense.
Morocco advanced to a quarter-final clash. It was a historic occasion as Morocco became only the fourth African team to reach the quarterfinals of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002, and Ghana in 2010. Morocco also became the first African nation to win a penalty shoot-out in the FIFA World Cup finals.
Although it was a team effort but one man who stood out for Morocco in the crunch moment was the goalkeeper Yassine Bounou. The Moroccon shot-stopper also created a bit of history for himself as he became the first African goalkeeper ever to save two penalties in a FIFA World Cup penalty shootout.

DOHA, Qatar -- Having made his international debut in 2008, it did not take long for Eiji Kawashima to establish himself as Japan's first-choice goalkeeper.
Two years later, he would feature for the Samurai Blue at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa -- the first of four consecutive tournaments he would be present at with Kawashima currently part of the squad at Qatar 2022.
Things are slightly different for him this time around though.
Having been -- quite literally -- the first name on the Japan starting XI at the past three editions of the World Cup, Kawashima is now only No. 1 in jersey allocation with Shuichi Gonda currently the main man in goal for coach Hajime Moriyasu.
The fact that the Strasbourg man is playing a lesser role these days is hardly surprising considering he will turn 40 in March, although he remains in supreme condition, and is no longer getting as much regular first-team football at club level as would be expected from a national team's starting goalkeeper.
Yet, that does not mean Kawashima has not been performing his role for the team in a remarkable campaign thus far, which has seen them claim dramatic come-from-behind wins over powerhouses Germany and Spain to reach the Round of 16 for the second consecutive tournament.
Having always displayed quiet but firm leadership qualities, the sheer experience of the Saitama native makes him a calming presence in the dressing room and a pillar of support for the younger members of the playing group.
In the immediate aftermath of Japan's win over Spain, when it looked like the frenzy of photographers clicking away by the sidelines was at risk of spilling over and into the players on their lap of honour, the powerfully-built 1.85 metre Kawashima was almost playing the role of half-protective big brother, half-menacing bodyguard -- ensuring no harm was going to befall the likes of Takefusa Kubo and Ritsu Doan.
From the warmups in training and before matches, Kawashima almost doubles up as a second goalkeeping coach for Gonda and the bond between them -- and the third option in Daniel Schmidt -- has been emblematic of the 'goalkeepers' union' -- best illustrated when the reserve duo wildly charged straight towards the first-choice to celebrate at the final whistle of Thursday's triumph over the Spanish.
Perhaps most importantly, his sheer availability will help keep Moriyasu's mind at ease, knowing he has a seasoned campaigner ready to be called upon whenever the need arises.
""For sure (this World Cup has been different). For the last three World Cups, I played in all the games,"" Kawashima told ESPN exclusively.
""But I'm always loyal for the Japanese national team because it is always an honour to be here.
""I'm really excited to be part of this team and what we're achieving, including this amazing result (against Spain). So I just try to give my everything to this team.
""It's been really amazing. This group was really tough -- we had Germany and Spain. It was difficult but we believed in ourselves and it has been a good result.""
Known for being fluent in seven languages, the well-spoken Kawashima has exuded a sense of maturity and being grounded even in his younger days.
His ability to accept the fact that he now has to settle for a back-up role behind Gonda could easily stem from the fact that he was once on the other side of the equation -- back at the 2010 World Cup when he was expected to be an emergency option for the Samurai Blue but ended up being promoted to the starting XI ahead of two veterans in the presumed No. 1 Seigo Narazaki and legendary captain Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
It is this very quality of being level-headed that is also keeping him from getting overly carried away with what the Japanese have achieved so far in Qatar.
""No, no, no -- we've got to win game by game,"" Kawashima hastily dismissed, when asked if they could start dreaming of potentially getting to a World Cup final.
""Now we're really confident but also modest. We know our potential, we believe that we can do something.
""We believed in ourselves (that we could beat Spain) -- that was our goal. Now, for sure the next game (against Croatia) will be a difficult game too, but we'll try to do our best.""
That much is for certain.
Whether it has been in one of those 95 caps he has already won for Japan, or more recently on the sidelines as a figure of leadership and support for his younger peers, Kawashima can always be counted on to do his best for the Samurai Blue cause."

FIFA World Cup 2022 Final: Kylian Mbappe won the Golden Boot Award in the 2022 edition of the tournament pipping Lionel Messi in an incredible burst in the second half of the game.
In Short
- 23-year-old Kylian Mbappe scored 2 stunning goals in the FIFA World Cup Final
- Mbappe turned the game on his head singlehandedly
By India Today Web Desk: Kylian Mbappe pipped Lionel Messi in an epic finish to the Golden Boot race in the final of the FIFA World Cup 2022. Messi and Mbappe came into the final of the FIFA World Cup with 5 goals each but Messi was the one to take a lead after converting his penalty in the first half.
Things seemed lost for France late in the second half when they were trailing 2-0 against Argentina and had not taken a single shot till the 70th minute of the game. However, Mbappe had other ideas a produced a tremendous burst of two minutes scoring 2 goals to turn the game on its head.
Mbappe goals stunned Argentina who looked devastated after losing the grip of the game. Mbappe kept becoming more threatening as the game progressed in the final minutes of the game and kept the Argentine defence on its toes with his pace.
Mbappe pipped Lionel Messi's 7 goals in the tournament, and scored 8 of his own, with 2 goals coming from penalties. At regulation time, Mbappe was ahead of Messi but the Argentine captain drew level in the dying moments of extra time, tapping in a rebound from Hugo Lloris.
Messi now holds the record of scoring at least one goal in all the knockout matches of the FIFA World Cup, has scored 4 goals from penalties.
The Argentine captain was once again taken over by Mbappe in the extra time, when Montiel conceded a penalty in the 118th minute of the game. Mbappe converted his final shot on goal and finished the tournament with 8 goals, and straight out beat Messi in the number of goals. This meant that Mbappe, at just 23, is now a Golden Boot winner at the FIFA World Cup, and has the most number of finals goals in the FIFA World Cup."

World Cup: FIFA speaks on Ronaldo’s controversial penalty against Ghana
FIFA’s expert World Cup analysts have said Cristiano Ronaldo performed a stroke of “genius” to win the penalty for Portugal in their 3-2 win over Ghana at the 2022 World Cup.
Ronaldo became the first male footballer to score at five World Cups on Thursday.
The 37-year-old converted a controversial penalty after the referee adjudged that he was brought down by Ghana defender Mohammed Salisu.
Ghana coach, Otto Addo, claimed it was a “special gift” for Portugal after the match.
FIFA’s Technical Study Group (TSG) held a media briefing in Doha, in which they claimed this year’s World Cup is on track for a record number of awarded penalties.
“Maybe the strikers are getting smarter?
“If you look at the penalty that Ronaldo got, people can say what they want about this man, but the smartness and the ingenious thought to just be patient and wait for that split second to touch the ball first before you, and continue my leg so that your contact will hit my leg, that is total genius,” former Colombia goalkeeper and TSG panel member, Faryd Mondragon, said.
A total of nine penalties have been awarded in the first 16 games.
At this rate, the World Cup is on track for a record 36 in the entire 64-game tournament."

FT - It's all over! France beat Morocco 2-0 to set up final date with Argentina
France set up a heavyweight World Cup final against Argentina after an early goal by Theo Hernandez and a late one from Randal Kolo Muani ended battling Morocco’s dream run via an action-packed 2-0 semi-final victory on Thursday. Full back Hernandez stretched high after five minutes to hook in the first goal Morocco have conceded to an opposition player in the tournament after a scramble in the box, but the holders offered only occasional glimpses of their class. Morocco, disrupted by early injuries to two key defenders, recovered to cause no end of problems, with Hugo Lloris brilliantly saving Jawad El Yamiq's overhead kick at the end of the first half and the outsiders pouring forward for much of the second. However, they could not quite fashion a clear enough chance for the equaliser and were unable to extend the astonishing run that included victories over Belgium, Spain and Portugal and made them the first African team to make the semi-finals. France settled it in the 79th minute when a brilliant dribble by Kylian Mbappe set up Kolo Muani to tuck in the decisive goal with his first touch less than a minute after coming on. France will be hugely relieved to become the first defending champions to reach successive finals since Brazil in 2002 and can now look forward to Sunday's showdown when they will bid to follow Brazil (1962) and Italy (1938) as the third team to retain the title.

https://www.kreedon.com/why-india-doesnt-play-fifa-world-cup/,"The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious tournament held every four years and the 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup started on 20th November and will conclude on 18th December 2022. Footballers from across the world have been showcasing their talent for their teams. However, all countries can’t take part in the FIFA World Cup because there is a limit on the number of teams. There is a huge fan following in India who wants to see their country playing at the World Cup. But this time again, India did not play in Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 because they were eliminated in the second round of the Asian World Cup qualifiers and were placed 3rd in Group E with seven points.
Football in India is quite popular and many states in India have regional governing bodies as there are 37 state associations affiliated with the All India Football Federation. Indian football has come a long way and different football clubs and franchises have seen a catastrophic change in the face of the world’s most loved sport in recent decades.
The Suspension of AIFF by FIFA
Recently, the Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) suspended the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The sudden suspension came after FIFA suspected undue third-party interference in the management of the AIFF, a breach of FIFA’s statutes. However, this ban was lifted after a few days, but even then the case was very embarrassing for India.
Team India: A “Sleeping Giant” in Football World?
In 2006, then FIFA president Sepp Blatter described India as a ‘sleeping giant’ in the football world. From the national team line-up to the domestic tournaments, there have been humongous changes in recent years, but the blue tigers have failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.
The young players from India are doing quite well in domestic leagues and may have won hearts, and attracted huge crowds to their matches, but the fact remains that Indian football still has a long way to go before it can earn the status to play in the FIFA World Cup.
Led by Sunil Chhetri, the Indian football team was knocked out in the second round of the qualifying stage. India is in the 106th position in the official ranking of FIFA and even failed to acquire a spot in the top hundred. Many people believe that the biggest reason for India not qualifying for FIFA WC is that football is not as popular as cricket in India. Many people prefer cricket over football, so talent is not recognized. The Indian football team is working hard to be one of the best but less media coverage and inappropriate sponsorship are becoming a big factor in the Indian team’s game.

When was the last time India qualified for the FIFA WC?
The Indian football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup held in Brazil in 1950 and despite this, the team did not play in the World Cup.
India was scheduled against Sweden, Italy, and Paraguay in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. But FIFA banned India from the tournament for ‘disagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time. But there were rumors that the Indian team wanted to play barefoot but wasn’t allowed.
Since then, India has never qualified for the quadrennial FIFA showpiece. Interestingly, several members of the Indian team competed in the 1948 London Olympic football tournament barefoot, with their feet bound in bandages to prevent injury.
Top Reasons Why India is not so popular in the Football World
India: The craze for Cricket Over Football
The condition of all sports apart from cricket is nearly the same when we consider fan support. Cricket is considered a religion in India as billions of Indians watch and follow cricket. Other leagues like ISL and PKL have been gaining popularity but not as same as IPL. In many games of the Indian national football and a few I-league clubs, the attendance to these games averages around 20k to 40k (except for a few games like the Kolkata derby).
It makes a massive difference if you have a huge crowd cheering for you and your team.

Lack of Infrastructure & Long-Term Vision
The Lack of infrastructure and long-term vision are two of the biggest factors creating hindrances in the growth of football in India. India lacks a quality football stadium. Few of the biggest and most popular clubs in India don’t have proper training and medical facilities.
In places like Delhi, and other states where this sport is quite popular, the government needs to establish new football centers and provide training facilities to budding talents. In India, football stadiums with international standards are in fewer numbers as compared to the size of the Indian geographical area and fan following. In India, more than 30 million viewers watch the European Football League so it is high time that Indian football should be promoted at the grassroots level.
Promotion of Sport
India is always known as a cricketing nation. One of the major reasons that India held a poor ranking in FIFA is because of the lack of proper facilities and awareness about the sport. AIFF has somehow failed in the promotion of football on the global platform.
The domestic leagues of football have gained huge popularity in India. The arrival of ISL (Indian Super League) has seen a renewed interest in football among the masses. In India, football is popular in states like Goa, Kerala, Manipur, and West Bengal but most ISL clubs don’t have proper training facilities and academies.

1978 v the Netherlands[edit]
Argentina hosted the 1978 edition of the World Cup and reached the final. The Netherlands had already played the previous final in West Germany 1974 - and also lost to the hosts.
Diego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach César Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes, who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals.
The Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later.
The closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time.

Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup.[5] With the scores tied at 3–3, the match was completed by a penalty shootout.

From 1994 towards, three points are given for a win. Previously were two.
Against conferences[edit]
FIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America. Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian (OFC) squad.

Miscellaneous[edit]
Argentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malmö. Germany won 3–1.[11][12]
In the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata's local club Kimberley. France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3–1.[13][14]
The stadium José María Minella is the southernmost World Cup venue located at 38°0′0″S 57°33′0″W / 38.00000°S 57.55000°W. Including France vs. Hungary, several matches of the 1978 World Cup were played in this stadium. Mar del Plata is in the south of Buenos Aires Province.[15]
In addition, Argentina played against Nigeria at Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg in 2018 making it the northernmost game along other six matches. The Russian city is at 59°58′22.63″N 30°13′13.92″E / 59.9729528°N 30.2205333°E.[16]
Referees[edit]
As a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy, where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, Néstor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia. They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament.

The quarterfinal clash at the Lusail Stadium saw a total of 19 bookings, breaking the record of the Portugal vs Netherlands round of 16 match in the 2006 World Cup, popularly known as the ‘Battle of Nuremberg.’
Out of the 19 bookings, two were shown to Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni and support staff Walter Samuel. Netherlands full-back Denzel Dumfries was the only player to see a second yellow during the penalty shootout.
Argentina captain Lionel Messi has slammed the referee after the match, calling him ‘not up to the mark’.
“I don’t want to talk about referees because then they will sanction you,” Messi said during the post-match interview with the organiser, “But we were scared before the game because we knew what was coming [with Mateu Lahoz]. They cannot put a referee like that on this game when he is not up to the level,” he added.
FIFA, however, did over disciplinary proceedings against the Argentina Football Federation after the remarks.
“The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has opened proceedings against the Argentinian Football Association due to potential breaches of articles 12 (Misconduct of players and officials) and 16 (Order and security at matches) of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the Netherlands vs Argentina FIFA World Cup match,” it said in a statement.
In the World Cup 2022, Lahoz officiated three matches and issued 23 yellow cards, which comprised two group stage matches and one quarterfinal. He was in charge of the Qatar vs Senegal and USA vs Iran clashes, respectively. In two games, he issued a total of eight yellow cards."

- USA is a distant third
WHAT HAPPENED? India have recorded the second-highest number of visitors in Qatar with 56,893 fans, according to a report published by FIFA. This is already more than the number of fans who had gone to Russia to watch the World Cup. Saudi Arabia tops the chart with 77, 106 fans while USA, UK and Mexico complete the top five with 36,236, 30,719 and 25,533 supporters respectively at the end of group stages.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: FIFA's numbers also show a cumulative stadium attendance of 2.45 million spectators. It boasts of an average 96 per cent occupancy in each game and is significantly higher than the corresponding 2.17 million figure recorded four years back in Russia.
Though India haven't qualified for the World Cup, the tournament remains popular among Indian fans. The World Cup has also generated a lot of excitement in the country. With Qatar geographically close to the Indian subcontinent, fans from India have utilised the chance to flock to Qatar and revel in the atmosphere of a World Cup.
WHAT THEY SAID?: “It’s been a fantastic World Cup, with groundbreaking figures and memorable moments both on and off the pitch. Fans are having an amazing time in Doha, and the whole world is following with excitement on TV as new records as set every day,” said FIFA COO World Cup, Colin Smith.

Russia had qualified for the World Cup playoffs after finishing second in Group H in the UEFA qualifiers. It was all set to play Poland in the playoff on March 24, when Russian forces began their attack on Ukraine on February 24.
This pushed the three sides in Russia’s playoff pool -- Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden -- to threaten boycott.
On February 28, FIFA and UEFA, under recommendations from IOC, suspended Russia and Russian clubs from participating in the their competitions including the 2022 World Cup.
Russia soon appealed the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but it was turned down on March 18. As a result, Poland got a walkover and then beat Sweden to secure its place in Qatar 2022."

https://www.gqindia.com/sports/content/10-interesting-facts-about-the-fifa-world-cup-2022,"The FIFA World Cup 2022 got underway in Qatar on 20 November. A total of 32 teams will be seen in action across a span of one month, with the final scheduled to be played on December 18. This is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world, and the last to feature 32 teams. From the next edition in 2026, the number of participating teams will increase to 48. France is the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 final. Here are 10 interesting facts about the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
As per Bloomberg, Qatar has spent a whopping $300 billion (Rs 2442000 crore) to organise the World Cup. As per Economic Times, the construction of new stadiums cost $6.5 billion (Rs 530 crore). In comparison, Russia had spent only $14.2 billion (Rs 115913 crore) to organise the 2018 World Cup, per Forbes.
The Qatar World Cup will be played across 28 days, which makes it the shortest football World Cup since 1998. Since the World Cup became a 32-team tournament in 1998, the 2014 edition in Brazil was held over 32 days while the shortest 32-team World Cup was played across 31 days. The opening match of the 2022 World Cup was played on November 20, with the final to be held on December 18.
As the host country, Qatar’s national football team automatically qualified for the World Cup 2022. This is their first appearance at the FIFA World Cup. However, they lost their opening game to Ecuador.
This is the first time that the football World Cup is being played in the months of November and December instead of May, June, or July. Summers in Qatar get harsh, which is why the tournament has been held in winter when the weather is pleasant. This, however, has played a spoilsport to the European league schedules.
18-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko of Germany is the youngest player at the 2022 World Cup. At the Bundesliga in 2022, he helped Borussia Dortmund with three assists and six goals. The oldest player, meanwhile, is Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary, aged 45.
As per The Hindu, more than 1.5 million people applied for the compulsory pass for the tournament. The pass serves as a visa, transport and match ticket and gives access to fan zones. The two international airports in Doha are prepared to handle 150,000 entries a day during the course of the tournament. As per Bloomberg, nearly 3 million tickets had been sold by mid-October.
As per TOI, as many as five billion people are expected to tune in to watch the 2022 World Cup. That is more than half of the world’s population!
There are only eight teams in the world that have won the prestigious FIFA World Cup. Brazil has five wins, while Germany and Italy have four wins each. Uruguay, Argentina and France have two titles each, while Spain and England have one each. Six of these eight teams have won the trophy as a host – England, Italy, Uruguay, Argentina, Germany and France.
Qatar has banned the sale of alcohol at the Fifa World Cup 2022 stadiums. Beer will be available only in hospitality boxes and in fan zones after 7 pm. Pork-based items, balloons, loud music instruments, pride flags and cigarettes are also banned inside the stadiums.
Argentina and Paris Saint-Germain icon Lionel Messi, 35, confirmed in October that Qatar 2022 will be his last, while Portugal and Manchester United player, 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo is yet to make a comment on his future in international football. Messi are Ronaldo are unarguably two of the greatest players to have played the game."

Lionel Messi now has surpassed Diego Maradona with 22 appearances at FIFA World Cup
For Lionel Messi, Argentina's last Group C game is a special one. The Argentine star knows that his team has to win the match in order to qualify for the Round of 16. Lionel Messi reignited Argentina's World Cup challenge with a superb goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico. Messi breathed fresh life into Argentina's campaign with his eighth World Cup goal in his fifth appearance in the finals. The 35-year-old maestro, desperate to crown his glittering career by lifting football's greatest prize, rifled home a low shot on 64 minutes to put Argentina en route to victory. Messi's goal meant he tied the late Diego Maradona on eight goals and 21 appearances at the World Cup for Argentina.
After he was named in the starting line-up against Poland, Messi now has surpassed Maradona with 22 appearances at the World Cup.
In the match against Poland, Enzo Fernandez was rewarded for his World Cup goal against Mexico with his first-ever start for Argentina as manager Lionel Scaloni made four changes to face Poland on Wednesday. The Benfica player replaces Guido Rodriguez in midfield, with Julian Alvarez coming in for Lautaro Martinez up front. The other two changes were in defence, with Nahuel Molina replacing Gonzalo Montiel and Cristian Romero coming back into the side in place of Lisandro Martinez.
Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz made one change, with forward Karol Swiderski coming in for Arkadiusz Milik.
Argentina need a win to be sure of progressing, while a point would be enough if Mexico and Saudi Arabia draw in the other Group C game.
Poland can qualify for the last 16 for the first time since 1986 with a draw.

England is the most valuable team at the Qatar World Cup 2022 with an estimated transfer value of some $1.54bn, study says.
England have the most valuable squad at the Qatar World Cup 2022, with the team’s Jude Bellingham topping a list of more than 800 football players in terms of transfer value, a study has found.
According to a study by Swiss research group CIES Football Observatory, England’s 26-man squad is worth just less than 1.5 billion euros ($1.54bn) in transfer value, with 19-year-old Bellingham valued at 202 million euros ($207.4m).
The Borussia Dortmund player enhanced his reputation as one of the world’s top young players with a superb goal in England’s 6-2 victory over Iran in their World Cup tournament opener on Monday.
Here is a look at how the other major football teams compare at the World Cup tournament:
Transfer Value
Brazil are second on the list after England with a transfer value of 1.45 billion euros ($1.49bn), and Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior was their most valuable player at 200 million euros ($205m).
France were third with an estimated transfer value of 1.34 billion ($1.38bn) for their squad. Paris St Germain (PSG) forward Kylian Mbappe was their top player, with a value of 185 million euros ($190m).
The top three were followed by Spain at 1.2 billion euros ($1.23bn), Portugal at 1.15 billion euros ($1.18bn) and Germany at 1.02 billion euros ($1.05bn).
The CIES Football Observatory put the overall value of all the squads at the World Cup 2022 at 15 billion euros ($15.4bn) based on a statistical technique involving more than 2,000 transactions of players transferred from clubs in the five major European leagues during the period from July 2012 to November 2021.
Insurable value:
In terms of insurable value, England’s squad again topped the list of World Cup teams with an estimated insurable value of 3.17 billion pounds ($3.76bn), according to an analysis by Lloyd’s of London and backed by the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
England edged out France at 2.66 billion pounds ($3.15bn) and Brazil at 2.56 billion pounds ($3.04bn) to claim the top spot.
Lloyd’s said the assessment of insurable value comprises a variety of metrics such as wages, sponsorship, age and on-field positions.
Bellingham was rated the most insurable player, followed by Mbappe and Vinicius Jr.
Lloyd’s model is based on the belief that the quality of a team can be assessed by measuring factors such as player salaries, incomes from endorsements, and ages, as the value of a team is a good indicator of its talent on the pitch."

https://olympics.com/en/news/england-at-fifa-world-cup-2022-records-and-stats,"Get all of England's statistics, records, milestones and numbers at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. How are the 'Three Lions' trying to rewrite history? Find out the top facts about Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, Marcus Rashford, coach Gareth Southgate and the rest.
The FIFA World Cup 2022 is entering its decisive phase, and England are keen on seizing the moment for more glory at Qatar.
After topping their group and beating Senegal 3-0 in the round-of-16, the 'Three Lions' have set up a mouth-watering quarter-final clash with France, hoping to rewrite football history .
From captain Harry Kane on the brink of putting himself into England's folklore to Jude Bellingham sprinkling moments of magic in the knockout rounds, the 1966 World Cup winners are leaving their mark on this tournament.
Read on to discover which records have already been broken and what beckons for Gareth Southgate and his side.
Harry Kane is on the verge of immortality for England as he hones in Wayne Rooney's goalscoring record.
The Tottenham Hotspur marksman scored against Senegal to take his goal tally to 52, one away from Rooney's 53 that currently makes him England's top goal-scorer.
Perhaps it is a good omen for Kane that the last time he faced France, he netted twice - something that, if he were to replicate on Saturday evening (10 December), would see him reach the holy grail.
The 29-year-old was playing alongside Rooney the day he broke Bobby Charlton's record in 2015, and the Manchester United legend told Kane that he believed he would be the successor to his goal-scoring throne.
But while the game against Les Blues could be a record-breaking one for the striker, he has already claimed a different one while out in Qatar.
His round-of-16 strike made him the highest English goal-scorer in major tournaments with 11, overtaking Gary Lineker's previous record of 10 - making it seven at the World Cup and four at the European Championships.
The Borussia Dortmund midfielder has been showing that age is merely just a number when it comes to the big stage, emerging as one of England's standout players so far.
The 19-year-old became the first teenager to score for England in this prestegious tournament since Michael Owen in 1998 when he netted the Three Lions' opening goal against the Islamic Republic of Iran in their first outing in Qatar.
Yet again, since Owen in '98, Bellingham became the first teenager to start for England in the World Cup knockout phase when he was named in the starting XI to face Senegal.
During that round-of-16 tie, he assisted Jordan Henderson's opening goal - making him the first teen to assist in the knockout rounds of this competition since records began.
England went on to win that game 3-0, and it was yet another dazzling display from the Dortmund man.
Marcus Rashford rightfully stole the headlines when England beat rivals Wales 3-0 in their final game of Group B.
The 25-year-old Manchester United forward scored twice on the night, opening England's account with a delightful free-kick from just outside the area.
His second came from a venemous strike that flew through Danny Ward's legs and into the back of the net. Not only did it effectively seal the three points, but it also marked England's 100th FIFA World Cup goal.
The first goal for the English at the tournament was netted by Stan Mortensen in 1950.
Other countries to have scored 100 goals or more at a World Cup include Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain.
Not only was England's rampant display against the Islamic Republic of Iran - in which they won 6-2 - a statement victory, it was also an important milestone for manager Gareth Southgate.
The three points meant that Southgate has won more matches at major tournaments for the 'Three Lions' than any of his predecessors, including Sir Alf Ramsey who won eight.
Another win in the group stage (vs Wales) and first knockout stage (vs Senegal) takes his standing tally to 11.
Their last 16 triumph was the sixth knockout game England have won under Southgate's guidance, the same amount they managed to win in the previous 48 years.
There has been a record number of draws at the FIFA World Cup 2022 so far, and England and USA played out the fifth goalless encounter on Friday 25 November.
Despite both sides having their fair share of chances, neither could find a breakthrough and had to share the points in the end.
The occassion marked 22nd draws at World Cups for the 'Three Lions', which is a record. Italy has the second most with 21 draws.
Their stalemate with the USA resulted in them hitting a milestone for draws, but England have been firing on all fronts in their other games.
In fact, they have scored 12 goals across their four games so far in Qatar, their joint-most at a single major tournament.
It equals their tally from the prevous World Cup in 2018, where they went on to bow out in the semi-finals against Croatia.
The English will need to be in full goal-scoring flow to beat rivals France in the quarter-finals and reach the semi-finals for a second successive time in this competiton.
With a place in the last-eight confirmed, there is still time for England to continue writing their name in the history books - but their biggest test of the tournament is up next.
Southgate and his side are set to take on reigning champions France in the quarter-finals, with a place in the last four at stake.
That fierce battle will take place on Saturday 10 December, kicking off at 10pm local time. That is 7pm GMT and 8pm CET."
https://olympics.com/en/news/world-cup-2022-female-referees-top-facts-qatar,"Women referees have been selected to officiate at the FIFA men's World Cup for the first time in history. Here are the top things you need to know about Yamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart.
Three referees are making history as they will officiate at the men's football World Cup in Qatar.
Stephanie Frappart, Yamashita Yoshimi and Salima Mukansanga are among the 36 referees selected for the tournament.
The final is scheduled for December 18.
They will also be joined by Neuza Back of Brazil, Mexico's Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt who are headed to the World Cup as three of 69 assistant referees.
Here's what you need to know about FIFA's trailblazing officiating trio.
The French official is arguably one of the most recognised names listed for the 2022 World Cup.
Stephanie Frappart will become the first woman in history to officiate a men's World Cup match when Germany play Costa Rica on Thursday (1 December).
She was already the fourth official in Mexico's game with Poland earlier in the tournament.
The 38-year-old has a career littered with firsts, and in Qatar she will continue to blaze a trail in her wake.
Frappart took the reigns in her first final in 2019 at the World Cup in France, and went on to officiate at the UEFA Super Cup final in the same year.
In 2020 she made waves in the refereeing world, writing her name in the history books by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men's Champions League match. A year later, Frappart would lead the way as Atletico Madrid faced Chelsea in a second leg round of 16 tie in the women's UCL.
Before being announced as part of the plans for Qatar, she also refereed the 2022 Coupe de France final.
Frappart's conduct on the pitch speaks for itself, and has resulted in her winning IFFHS World's Best Woman Referee award three years on the bounce from 2019.
The presence of women officials at the men's World Cup will send a ""strong"" message, according to the Frenchwoman.
""It's a strong sign from FIFA and the authorities to have women referees in that country,"" she said, adding her hopes that this decision can ""make things happen"".
Japanese referee Yamashita Yomishi will appear at a second consecutive World Cup after officiating the 2019 Women's World Cup in France.
She also took charge at the 2020 Olympic Games, held in 2021, in a game between the United States and Sweden.
But refereeing in Qatar won't be the only time she has made history this year.
Yamashita was on the whistle for Melbourne City's 2-1 win over Jeonnam Dragons in the AFC Champions League, and FC Tokyo's 2-0 win over Kyoto Sanga in the J1 League - becoming the first female referee to do so.
The 36-year-old is relishing in the opportunity to be part of history, in spite of the pressures that come with it.
""There are hardly any female referees in the Middle East, so I would like to see that change, with the Qatar World Cup as the catalyst,"" she said.
""The fact that women are officiating for the first time at a men's World Cup is a sign to other people that women's potential is always growing and that is something I also feel strongly about.""
Rwandan referee Salima Mukansanga has been officiating for FIFA since 2012.
But as a young girl, her dream was to play basketball professionally.
""I liked basketball and wanted to take it very seriously,"" she told New Times.
""But access to basketball infrastructure was hard, that's how I ended up in refereeing, which I have also never regretted.""
And that decision has led her to the 2019 Women's World Cup, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, and now Qatar.
Much like Yamashita, she also involved in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics last year.
Mukansanga is no stranger to the world stage, having also taken charge at the men's Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year.
When named as an official for the 2019 WWC, she said: “Officiating at the World Cup is every referee’s dream,"" and for the trailblazing Rwandan, the dream continues next month.
The trio will be joined by three more female officials as FIFA selects 69 assistant referees for the World Cup.
The aforementioned Back, Medina and Nesbitt will all write their names in the tournament's folklore.
Each of them have had their different routes into the profession, but will share a unified history-making moment when they officiate in Qatar.
Medina began her career in refereeing by pure chance, but believes it is a position that ""makes you fall more and more in love every day [with football].""
USA's Nesbitt started refereeing as a summer job, but up until the 2019 WWC was a professor of chemistry.
In 2020, she was named the MLS Assistant Referee of the Year - becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat.
""It has been an absolute honour to have people say that I’ve become a role model for women,"" Nesbitt told FIFA.
37-year-old Back didn't even realise that she had been selected in the 69-name list until she heard it in the press.
""It's very cool, indescribable, it's a moment of joy, of gratitude, and also a little sense of responsibility,"" Back told the media.
Despite any outside pressures, all the ground-breaking officials selected for Qatar are relishing the opportunity to represent women referees in what could be a defining moment going forward."
https://www.livemint.com/news/world/saudi-arabia-declares-public-holiday-to-celebrate-victory-against-argentina-fifa-world-cup-2022-11669177394380.html,"Saudi Arabia declares public holiday to celebrate victory against Argentina in FIFA World Cup 20221 min read . Updated: 23 Nov 2022, 01:00 PM IST
Saudi Arabia broke Argentina's 36-match unbeaten streak and secured what turned out to be their fourth win in a world cup match since they had started competing in 1994.
Saudi Arabia's 2-1 victory over Argentina was the first shocker at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Following the game, Saudi Arabia declared a public holiday on November 23 to honour the team's unexpected triumph over Argentina, the two-time champions presently captained by arguably the greatest player of all time - Lionel Messi.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino was present for the game, when this happened.
DFB, the Germany football association, soon released a statement regarding the protest: “We wanted to use our captain’s armband to take a stand for values that we hold in the Germany national team: diversity and mutual respect.”
“Together with other nations, we wanted our voice to be heard. It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn’t the case. That’s why this message is so important to us. Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position,” added DFB in the statement.
Nancy Faeser, the German minister of the Interior and Community, was seen along with German Football Association President Bernd Neuendorf, wearing the ‘OneLove’ armband in the stands
Earlier this week, Football Associations of seven nations released a joint statement, advising their players against wearing the ‘OneLove’ armband.
The armband represents support for equality and while it is not solely aimed at the rights of the LGBTQ community, it is significant in Qatar where homosexuality is illegal.
“We are very frustrated by the FIFA decision which we believe is unprecedented - we wrote to FIFA in September informing them of our wish to wear OneLove armband to actively support inclusion in football and had no response” said the joint statement of seven nations which includes England , the Netherlands, Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.
Neuer, along with the captains of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, England, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales, were reportedly set to wear the One Love armband during this edition of FIFA World Cup which commenced on November 20."
https://www.insider.com/qatar-becomes-first-world-cup-host-ever-lose-opening-match-2022-11,"- Qatar set an unwanted record in the first game of the 2022 World Cup on Sunday.
- It become the first host nation in the tournament's history to lose its opening match.
- Félix Sánchez's side was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador.
Qatar became the first host nation of the World Cup to ever lose its opening game at the tournament as it was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador on Sunday.
Striker Enner Valencia appeared to have opened the scoring after just three minutes in front of a packed crowd at Al Bayt Stadium, however his header was ruled out for an offside in the build-up.
But it didn't take Valencia long to find the net again, this time from the penalty spot in the 16th minute after he was brought down in the box by Qatar keeper Saad Al Sheeb.
Valencia then added his and Ecuador's second with a fine header in the 31st minute to complete the scoring.
""Ever since the draw took place I dreamt about this game,"" Valencia, who formerly played in the English Premier League for West Ham United and Everton and whose brace against Qatar saw him become his country's record World Cup goalscorer, told reporters after the match.
""I dreamt about playing in this opening game and winning - so it really is a dream come true. These games are about moments. We were able to score two early goals and it allowed us to take control.""
Qatar failed to register a single shot on target in the whole game, with striker Almoez Ali heading wide Qatar's best chance towards the end of the first half.
The disappointing performance prompted a large number of the host nation's fans to leave the stadium at the interval.
""It was won in the first half, a poor second half,"" said the former England men's striker turned BBC pundit Alan Shearer. ""Ecuador managed the game, kept the ball when they had to. It was flat in the second half, even the crowd disappeared after half-time.""
The former England women's star Alex Scott added: ""The disappointing thing with Qatar was, even when they got some possession, they were so sloppy with it. They gave it away.
""It could be a long group stage for the hosts.""
Any hopes of reaching the World Cup knockout phases now look bleak for Qatar.
The host, which is 50th in the FIFA world rankings, the third lowest of any team at the World Cup, next faces reigning Africa Cup of Nations champion, 18th ranked Senegal, on November 25.
It then faces Netherlands, which is ranked eighth, in its final Group A game on November 29.
Fail to make the last-16 and Qatar will become only the second host nation in World Cup history to ever go out at the group stage of the tournament.
The other was South Africa in 2010."

Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_Summary,"This is a record of Argentina's results at the FIFA World Cup. Argentina is one of the most successful teams in the tournament's history, having won three World Cups: in 1978, 1986, 2022. Argentina has also been runner up three times: in 1930, 1990 and 2014. In 18 World Cup tournaments, Argentina has 47 victories in 88 matches. The team was present in all but four of the World Cups, being behind only Brazil and Germany in number of appearances."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_1930 v Uruguay,"The inaugural FIFA World Cup tournament culminated with Argentina facing hosts and current Olympic champions Uruguay. The match was turned twice: Argentina went into half-time with a 2–1 lead in spite of an early goal for Uruguay, but the hosts ultimately won 4–2. Guillermo Stábile, one of Argentina's scorers, became the tournament's top striker with 8 goals total."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_1978 v the Netherlands,"Argentina hosted the 1978 edition of the World Cup and reached the final. The Netherlands had already played the previous final in West Germany 1974 - and also lost to the hosts.
Diego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach César Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes, who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals.
The Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later.
The closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_1986 v West Germany,"Eight years after the victory on home soil, Argentina won the World Cup title for the second time. Diego Maradona was voted Best Player of the tournament after scoring five goals and assisting the decisive 3-2 by Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute of the final. The match was played in front of a record attendance of 114,600 people."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_1990 v West Germany,"In 1990, Argentina faced West Germany in a repeat of the 1986 edition. Pedro Monzón became the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup final, but was later joined by teammate Gustavo Dezotti. The match was decided by a penalty kick in favour of Germany."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_2014 v Germany,"In 2014, Argentina reached the final for the fifth time and for a third time had to face the German team, making it the most recurrent meeting for a final. In spite of a number of chances on both sides, regular time finished goalless. In the second half of extra time, substitute striker Mario Götze scored the decisive goal for Germany."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_2022 v France,"Argentina opened up the scoring when Messi scored a penalty kick, and doubled their lead with a Di Maria goal in the 36th minute. France made two substitutions in the first half, but went into half-time trailing 0–2. Despite not having a shot until after the 80th minute, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area. Mbappé scored the penalty, and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores. With the scores tied, the match went to extra time. Messi scored again for Argentina in the second extra time half. Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after his initial shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup. With the scores tied at 3–3, the match was completed by a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4–2."

Teams with a * mark no longer exist. East Germany was annexed to Germany. Soviet Union now plays as Russia.
+Played as Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_Head coaches,"Through Argentinian team history, several coaches had trained it with different football styles from offensive to defensive tactics. There are two predominant 'football schools' about world champions coaches César Menotti who propagates possession and well-look play and Carlos Bilardo who prioritize results and tactical order. These head coaches divides Argentine fans kindly. Other managers such as Marcelo Bielsa has got his own football style. In another way this list shows records in World Cups and in qualifying stages excluding friendlies.

From 1994 towards, three points are given for a win. Previously were two."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_Against conferences,"FIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America. Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian (OFC) squad."

Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_Miscellaneous,"Argentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malmö. Germany won 3–1.In the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata's local club Kimberley. France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3–1.The stadium José María Minella is the southernmost World Cup venue located at 38°0′0″S 57°33′0″W. Including France vs. Hungary, several matches of the 1978 World Cup were played in this stadium. Mar del Plata is in the south of Buenos Aires Province.In addition, Argentina played against Nigeria at Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg in 2018 making it the northernmost game along other six matches. The Russian city is at 59°58′22.63″N 30°13′13.92″E."
Argentina at the FIFA World Cup_Referees,"As a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy, where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, Néstor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia. They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament."
2022 African Nations Championship_Summary,"The 2022 African Nations Championship, known as the 2022 CHAN for short and the TotalEnergies African Nations Championship for sponsorship purposes, was the 7th edition of the biennial association football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), featuring national teams consisting of players currently playing in their respective local leagues. It was held in Algeria from 13 January to 4 February 2023.
Originally scheduled from 10 July to 1 August 2022, CAF rescheduled the tournament to January 2023 following an announcement at an executive committee meeting held on 10 September 2020 via video conferencing, citing the postponement of the 2020 edition to 2021 and the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa as well as the already-scheduled 2022 FIFA World Cup in November – December 2022.Eighteen teams were supposed to be contesting in this edition, which would have been an increase of 2 teams from the previous edition in 2020; but defending champions Morocco were unable to defend their title due to political tensions with Algerian authorities which began with Algeria's unilaterally decision in 2021 to close its airspace to Moroccan flights, including and especially its official carrier Royal Air Maroc. 
Senegal won their first title, following on from their inaugural Africa Cup of Nations title win a year earlier, 5–4 on penalties against host nation Algeria in the final."
2022 African Nations Championship_Qualified teams,"The following teams qualified for the main tournament:
Morocco was originally set to take part in the tournament with their under-23 national team after their local national team was officially disbanded by the FRMF on 31 August 2022. However, the team announced their withdrawal from the tournament on 12 January 2023, after hosts Algeria refused to allow the squad to take a direct flight from Rabat to Constantine via their flag carrier sponsor, Royal Air Maroc."
2022 African Nations Championship_Mascot,"Algeria took the fennec fox as a mascot for the championship and named it ""COBTAN"". And the slogan of the edition was ""CHAN fi bled a chène"" (CHAN in the country of glory)."

2002 FIFA World Cup_Summary,"The 2002 FIFA World Cup, also branded as Korea Japan 2002, was the 17th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial football world championship for men's national teams organized by FIFA. It was held from 31 May to 30 June 2002 at sites in South Korea and Japan, with its final match hosted by Japan at International Stadium in Yokohama.
A field of 32 teams qualified for this World Cup, which was the first to be held in Asia, the first to be held outside of the Americas or Europe, as well as the first to be jointly-hosted by more than one nation. China, Ecuador, Senegal, and Slovenia made their World Cup debuts. 
The tournament had several upsets and surprise results, which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point without scoring a goal and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating  Poland, Portugal, Italy and Spain en route. They became the first team from outside of the UEFA, CONMEBOL, and CONCACAF regions to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup. However, the most potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed, winning the final against Germany 2–0, making them the first and only country to have won the World Cup five times. The victory qualified Brazil for the 2003 and subsequently 2005 FIFA Confederations Cups, its fourth and fifth Confederations Cup appearance in a row. In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3–2, taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup, and scored the fastest goal in the FIFA World Cup history (10.8 seconds after kick-off).The 2002 World Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule and the last one to use the same ball for all matches. Starting in 2006 and continuing to the present, a ball with the same technical specifics but different colors has been used in the final."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Host selection,"South Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and Mexico presented three rival bids. South Korea's entry into the race was seen by some as a response to the bid of political and sporting rival Japan. FIFA leaders were split on whom to favor as host as politics within the world governing body held sway. With Mexico regarded as a long shot, the battle to host the tournament came down to South Korea and Japan. The two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in. FIFA boss João Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid, but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans. UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option. South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting. South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico. This was the first World Cup to be hosted by more than one country, the second being the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. This is also the first ever World Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the 2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, twenty years later. The general secretary of South Korea's bidding committee, Song Young-shik, stated that FIFA was interested in staging some matches in North Korea in order to aid Korean reunification, but it was ruled out.At the time the decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998 competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022 (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament; they were defending Olympic champions from 1928).
The unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone. With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Qualification,"199 teams attempted to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. The qualification process began with the preliminary draw held in Tokyo on 7 December 1999. Defending champions France and co-hosts South Korea and Japan qualified automatically and did not have to play any qualification matches. This was the final World Cup in which the defending champions qualified automatically.14 places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia) and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and the Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and UEFA and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania). Four nations qualified for the finals for the first time: China, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia. As of 2022, this was the last occasion on which the Republic of Ireland and Turkey qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the only time that China have qualified, as well as the last time that Australia and Switzerland failed to qualify.
Turkey qualified for the first time since 1954, Poland and Portugal both qualified for the first time since 1986 and Costa Rica and Uruguay qualified for the first time since 1990. Sweden, Russia and the Republic of Ireland also returned after missing the 1998 World Cup. 1998 semi-finalists the Netherlands, three-time participants in the 1990s Romania and Colombia, and Bulgaria, Morocco and Norway, who had participated in the previous two finals tournaments, alongside Chile, Scotland and Iran which participated in the latest edition, failed to qualify, while South Korea set a record by appearing in a fifth successive finals tournament, the first nation from outside Europe or the Americas to achieve this feat.
All seven previous World Cup-winning nations (Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Uruguay) qualified, which broke the record of most previous champions at a tournament before the record was broken again in 2014. The highest ranked team not to qualify for the finals was Colombia (ranked 4th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was China PR (ranked 50th)."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Venues,"South Korea and Japan each provided 10 venues, the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament. Groups A–D played all their matches in South Korea and Groups E–H played all their matches in Japan. The stadiums in Daegu, Suwon, Yokohama and Saitama all hosted 4 matches each, while the other 16 stadiums hosted 3 matches each. Notably, no matches were played in Tokyo, making it the first capital of a host country not to have a World Cup venue.
A cross denotes an indoor stadium."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Match officials,"There was much controversy over the refereeing in the tournament. Questionable decisions in the match between Italy and South Korea resulted in 400,000 complaints, and featured in ESPN's 10 most fabled World Cup controversies. The match between Spain and South Korea featured two controversially disallowed Spanish goals, which Iván Helguera referred to as ""a robbery"" and led to Spanish press brandishing the officials ""thieves of dreams"", though FIFA dismissed the incident as human error."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Draw,"The FIFA Organising Committee announced the eight seeded teams on 28 November 2001. The historic tradition to seed the hosts (Japan and South Korea) and holders (France) was upheld; while the remaining five seeds were granted to the other five of the top six teams, ranked by their results in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio).For the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots; the eight top-seeded teams, were allocated in pot 1 and would be drawn/selected into the first position of the eight groups playing in the group stage. The remaining 24 unseeded teams, were allocated into three pots based on geographical sections, with the: 11 European teams in pot 2; two Asian teams and three South American teams in pot 3; three North American teams and five African teams in pot 4.The general principle was to draw one team from each pot into the eight groups, although with special combined procedures for pot 2 and pot 3, due to comprising more/less than eight teams - but sixteen teams in total. At the same time, the draw also needed to respect the geographical limitation, that each group could not feature more than one team from each confederation, except for the European teams where the limitation was maximum two per group. Finally, special limitations were also stipulated to evenly distribute the presence of teams from each confederation between the groups playing respectively in Korea (group A-D) and Japan (group E-H); while China for political considerations only could be drawn for one of the groups playing in Korea.
The draw took place at Busan Exhibition and Convention Center in South Korea, and was televised live on 1 December 2001: World Cup Draw 2002 on RTÉ.The FIFA Organising Committee decided ahead of the draw, to place the defending champions (France) in Group A; while the co-hosts South Korea and Japan were placed respectively in Group D and Group H. The procedure for the draw comprised the following six steps:
Pot 1 was used to draw, in alphabetic group order, the remaining five top-seeded teams for the first position of groups B, C, E, F and G; while respecting the restriction that one of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea (B/C) and the other had to play in a group played in Japan (E/F/G).
Pot 2 was used to draw one European team to each of the eight groups (drawing unrestricted in the alphabetic order from A to H).
As per the FIFA rule of only allowing a maximum of two European teams in each group, the remaining three European teams from Pot 2, was subject to a second draw, to be put in either of the four groups containing a top-seeded South American team or Asian team. This was done by first drawing the European team from Pot 2, and then drawing which seeded opponent the European team should be paired with, from a special bowl with four blue balls containing the names of Brazil, Argentina, Japan and South Korea.
Pot 3 was used to draw one team to each of the five groups with an empty third slot (drawing in alphabetical order from A to H); while respecting the geographical restrictions, that:
None of the unseeded South American teams (Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay) from pot 3, could be drawn into a group with a seeded South American team (Brazil and Argentina).
None of the unseeded Asian teams (Saudi Arabia and China) from pot 3, could be drawn into a group with a seeded Asian team (South Korea and Japan in Group D and H); along with the overall rule that China had to play in South Korea (meaning either group A, B or C) and that Saudi Arabia had to play in Japan (meaning either group E, F or G).
Pot 4 was used to draw one team to each of the eight groups (drawing in the alphabetic order from A to H); while respecting the restrictions that:
Minimum one North American team and minimum two African teams should be drawn to a group located in South Korea (Group A/B/C/D)
Minimum one North American team and minimum two African teams should be drawn to a group located in Japan (Group E/F/G/H)
To decide the match schedules, the exact group position number for the un-seeded teams in each group (2, 3 or 4), were also drawn immediately from eight special group bowls, after each respective team had been drawn from pot 2, 3 and 4.Besides of drawing the teams, the event also featured American vocalist Anastacia giving a debut public performance of the official song of the World Cup: Boom."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Draw results and group fixtures,"The draw resulted in the following eight groups:

In each group, the teams played three matches, one against each of the other teams. Victories were granted 3 points, while a draw was equal to 1 point. After completion of the Group stage, the best two teams of each group advanced to the Round of 16 in the knockout stage, in a way so all group winners started out meeting a runner-up from one of the other groups. This format was identical with the tournament structure being used in 1998. A total of 64 games were played, including the final and a bronze medal game between the two semifinale losers.
Group F was considered the group of death, as it brought together Argentina, England, Nigeria and Sweden.The fixtures for the Group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:"

The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Knockout stage,"For the second round, quarter-finals and semi-finals, the qualifiers from Groups A, C, F and H played their games in Japan while the qualifiers from Groups B, D, E and G played their games in South Korea. Daegu, South Korea, hosted the third-place match while Yokohama, Japan, hosted the final."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Round of 16,"In the round of 16, Germany beat Paraguay 1–0 with a late goal by Oliver Neuville in Seogwipo. England defeated Denmark in Niigata 3–0, with all goals occurring in the first half of the game. Sweden and Senegal faced off in Ōita and finished 1–1 in regular time and it took a golden goal from Henri Camara in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 2–1, which lead to Senegal becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990). Spain and the Republic of Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1–0 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go to extra time, where Spain emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out. The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2–0 in Jeonju with Brian McBride and Landon Donovan scoring the goals. Brazil defeated Belgium 2–0 in Kobe, with an amazing volley by Rivaldo and a splendid counter-attack goal by Ronaldo. Turkey ended co-hosts Japan's run with a 1–0 win in Miyagi, thanks to an Ümit Davala goal in the 12th minute. The other co-hosts, South Korea, defeated Italy 2–1 in extra time in Daejeon with a goal by Ahn Jung-hwan in the 117th minute. South Korea's win ensured that, for the very first time in the Cup's history, teams from five continents – Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia – reached the quarter-finals of the same tournament."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Quarter-finals,"In the quarter-finals, England and Brazil squared off in Shizuoka, where Ronaldinho scored a free-kick goal over England's David Seaman early in the second half as Brazil won 2–1. The United States lost to Germany 1–0 in Ulsan by a Michael Ballack goal in the 39th minute, but controversy surrounded the game when United States demanded the referee give a penalty for a goal-line handball by Torsten Frings in the 49th minute, but the referee did not award the penalty. South Korea got another success in Gwangju in a controversial manner, overcoming Spain 5–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in which the Spaniards twice thought they had scored while onside; however, the efforts were disallowed by the referee with controversial decisions. While the decisions were marginal, in both incidents the Korean players stopped playing after seeing the flag raised, allowing the goals to be scored. The hosts became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their North Korean counterparts who reached the quarter-finals in 1966. They also became the first World Cup semi-final team not from UEFA or CONMEBOL since the United States did it in the first World Cup in 1930. Turkey defeated Senegal 1–0 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by İlhan Mansız in the 94th minute."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Semi-finals,"The semi-finals saw 1–0 games; the first semi-final, played in Seoul, saw Michael Ballack's goal suffice for Germany to eliminate South Korea. However, Ballack had already received a yellow card during the match before, which forced him to miss the final based on accumulated yellow cards. The next day in Saitama saw Ronaldo score a goal early in the second half, his sixth of the competition for Brazil, to defeat Turkey in a replay of their Group C encounter."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Third place play-off,"In the third-place match in Daegu, Turkey beat the South Koreans 3–2, their first goal coming from Hakan Şükür straight from the opening kick-off (even though South Korea kicked off) in 10.8 seconds, the fastest ever goal in World Cup history."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Final,"In the final match held in Yokohama, Japan, two goals from Ronaldo secured the World Cup for Brazil as they claimed victory over Germany. Ronaldo scored twice in the second half and, after the game, won the Golden Shoe award for the tournament's leading scorer with eight goals. This was the fifth time Brazil had won the World Cup, cementing their status as the most successful national team in the history of the competition. Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shoot-out at some stage during the knockout phase and the total number of penalty shoot-outs (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup since 1970 and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Goalscorers,"Ronaldo won the Golden Shoe after scoring eight goals. In total, 161 goals were scored by 109 players, with three of them credited as own goals. Two of those own goals were in the same match, marking the first time in FIFA World Cup history that own goals had been scored by both teams in the same match."

2002 FIFA World Cup_Ticket sales problem,"The original domestic ticket allocation had fully sold out and the organising committee completed sales of tickets returned from the international allocation by the end of April. However, there were a significant number of empty seats at the opening matches. It was gradually revealed that the World Cup Ticketing Bureau (WCTB) still had unsold tickets in its possession. After FIFA agreed to sell this inventory, JAWOC undertook sales over telephone and WCTB handled the internet sales. For the second round Japan vs. Turkey match in Miyagi in particular, although it was reported by both parties that all tickets had been sold, some 700 seats remained empty."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Mascot,"The official mascot of this World Cup was ""Ato, Kaz, and Nik"" (The Spheriks), orange, purple, and blue (respectively) futuristic, computer-generated creatures. Collectively, members of a team of ""Atmosball"" (a fictional football-like sport), Ato is the coach while Kaz and Nik are players. The three individual names were selected from shortlists by users on the Internet and at McDonald's outlets in the host countries."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Cultural event,"The official FIFA cultural event of the 2002 World Cup was a flag festival called Poetry of the Winds. Held in Nanjicheon Park, an area of the World Cup Park close to Seoul World Cup Stadium, Poetry of the Winds was exhibited from 29 May to 25 June in order to wish success upon the World Cup and promote a festive atmosphere. During the flag art festival, hand-painted flags from global artists were displayed as a greeting to international guests in a manner that was designed to promote harmony (2002 Flag Art Festival Executive Committee)."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Concerns,"The World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations. However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not. While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season which could disrupt the play. The timing of the tournament thus had been altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986.The time difference caused issues for fans worldwide especially in Europe, where people had to go to work when matches were played."
2002 FIFA World Cup_Aftermath and legacy,"The tournament had a major economic impact on both South Korea and Japan, generating an estimated US$1.3 billion in revenue. Spending from World Cup tourists in South Korea created US$307 million in direct income and US$713 million in valued added. Japan spent an estimated US$5.6 billion on preparations for the event, which had a US$24.8 billion impact on the Japanese economy and accounted for 0.6% of their GDP in 2002."
Friend-to-friend_Summary,"A friend-to-friend (or F2F) computer network is a type of peer-to-peer network in which users only make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.
Unlike other kinds of private P2P, users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity. Retroshare, WASTE, GNUnet, Freenet and OneSwarm are examples of software that can be used to build F2F networks, though RetroShare is the only one of these configured for friend-to-friend operation by default.
Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two friends, without telling either of them the other's name or IP address. These friends can in turn automatically forward the same file (or request) to their own friends, and so on.
Dan Bricklin coined the term ""friend-to-friend network"" in 2000."
FIFA headquarters_Summary,"The headquarters of FIFA (German: FIFA-Hauptquartier) is a distinctive complex in Zürich. The complex has served as the official headquarters of FIFA since its completion in 2006. It is located on the Zürichberg, a wooded hill in District 7.
As well as offices, the complex includes a fitness centre, a meditation room, geographically themed parks, a full-size international football pitch and full-size beach football pitch.The main building has only two upper levels, but five underground levels, resulting in two thirds of the headquarters lying underground. ""Places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light,"" said Sepp Blatter, ""because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there."""
List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks_Summary,"The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. A hat-trick occurs when a player scores three or more goals in a single match and it is considered an achievement, especially while playing at the largest international football tournament in the world. Across the over 800 matches at the 22 tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, 54 hat-tricks have been scored. The first hat-trick was scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States, playing against Paraguay in 1930; the most recent was by Kylian Mbappé of France, playing against Argentina on 18 December 2022. The only World Cup not to have at least one hat-trick scored was the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The record number of hat-tricks in a single World Cup tournament is eight, during the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland.
19 players have scored a hat-trick in the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. Two were playing in their first ever World Cup match, Edmund Conen and Angelo Schiavio, both in 1934, a tournament without a group stage. Geoff Hurst (1966) & Kylian Mbappé (2022) are the only players to have scored a hat-trick in the final. Two players have scored a hat-trick in the second group stage of the World Cup, Paolo Rossi and Zbigniew Boniek, both in 1982."
List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks_Notable World Cup hat-tricks,"This section features records and notable hat-tricks relating to the men's World Cup. For notable hat-tricks at the Women's World Cup, see List of FIFA Women's World Cup hat-tricks#Notable World Cup hat-tricks.Bert Patenaude was the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, on 17 July 1930 against Paraguay. However, until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude. In 2006, FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as teammate Tom Florie's goal in the match against Paraguay was re-attributed to him.
Four players have scored two hat-tricks in World Cup matches: Sándor Kocsis (both 1954); Just Fontaine (both 1958); Gerd Müller (both 1970); and Gabriel Batistuta (1994 and 1998). Batistuta is thus the only person to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record of scoring hat-tricks, both were achieved on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty. Kocsis and Müller scored their hat-tricks in consecutive matches.
Oleg Salenko is the only player in World Cup history to have scored five goals in a single match. He did this during the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Russia and Cameroon.
One player has scored a hat-trick on his international début: Guillermo Stábile (1930).
One player has scored four goals for the losing side: Ernst Wilimowski (5–6, 1938).
Three other players have scored a hat-trick for the losing side: Josef Hügi (5–7, 1954), Kylian Mbappe (3–3, losing 4–2 on penalties, 2022), and Igor Belanov (3–4, 1986).
One other player has scored a hat-trick in a game that his side did not win: Cristiano Ronaldo (3–3, 2018)
There have been three occasions when two hat-tricks have been scored in the same match. Two occurred during the 1938 FIFA World Cup: when Sweden defeated Cuba, Gustav Wetterström and Harry Andersson, both playing for Sweden, scored three goals, with the former completing his in the first half. In the Brazil vs Poland, Leônidas did it for Brazil and Ernst Wilimowski for Poland. One occurred in 1954: when Austria defeated Switzerland, Theodor Wagner and Josef Hügi scored hat-tricks for Austria and Switzerland respectively.
Two players have scored hat-tricks in World Cup Finals. Geoff Hurst scored three goals for England against West Germany in the 1966 Final. This is also the longest hat-trick to be completed — most time between the first and third goals. His first goal came at 18', while the second and third goals were in extra time at 98' and 120'. Kylian Mbappé scored the other World Cup finals' hat-trick in the 2022 FIFA World Cup final for France against Argentina. His goals were scored at the 80th, 81st and 118th minute marks. Two of his goals - 80th and 118th - were successful penalty kicks.
The quickest hat-trick by a player is Erich Probst, who scored at 4', 21', and 24' in 1954, playing for Austria against Czechoslovakia in the first round.
The briefest hat-trick to be completed — that is, the shortest time between the first and third goals — is the one by László Kiss in 1982 against El Salvador. He scored at 69', 72', and 76', making the time between his first and third 7 minutes. This is also the only hat-trick scored by a substitute.
The only players to have scored from three headers in a single match are Tomáš Skuhravý in 1990 and Miroslav Klose in 2002.
The youngest player to score a hat-trick is Pelé, at 17 years, 244 days.
The oldest player to score a hat-trick is Cristiano Ronaldo, at 33 years, 130 days.
Germany (incl. West Germany) holds the record for most hat-tricks scored with 7. Germany also shares with South Korea the record for most hat-tricks conceded with 4."

FIFA World Cup Trophy_Summary,"The World Cup is a solid gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970, before the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. It is one of the most expensive trophies in sporting history, valued at $250,000.The first trophy, originally named Victory, but later renamed in honour of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and lapis lazuli. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil won the trophy outright in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.
The subsequent trophy, called the ""FIFA World Cup Trophy"", was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 karat gold with bands of malachite on its base, it stands 36.8 centimetres high and weighs 6.175 kilograms (30,875 carats). The trophy was made by the Stabilimento Artistico Bertoni company in Italy. It depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holders of the trophy are Argentina, winners of the 2022 World Cup."
FIFA World Cup Trophy_Jules Rimet Trophy,"The Jules Rimet Trophy was the original prize for winning the FIFA World Cup. Originally called ""Victory"", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base. In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winner's details. It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb).
It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.

During World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers' requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall. It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white mongrel dog named Pickles.

As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica. Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.On 19 December 1983, the wooden rear of the cabinet was opened by force with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold. Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb) of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president João Figueiredo in 1984."
FIFA World Cup Trophy_New trophy,"A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) or 30,875 carats of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kilograms (150–180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift. This is easy to understand since 18 k gold is an alloy made of 18 parts of gold, 5 parts of silver and 1 part of copper with a mean density of 15.6 gr/cm3. The trophy weighs 6175 g, this amount of alloy is just a volume of 390 cm3 or, in other words, would be a cube with a side of 7.3 cm, and the World Cup is clearly larger. This argumentation proves that the World Cup is indeed hollow. Moreover, its original manufacturer, who is the same that makes the official replicas, confirmed this characteristic.Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, ""The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory"".The trophy has the engraving ""FIFA World Cup"" on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zurich, Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final. The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition.The Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, however, that is no longer the case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language. For example, ""1974 Deutschland"" or ""1994 Brasil"". In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as ""2010 Spain"", in English, not in Spanish. This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup.As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners. FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. Germany became the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Argentina became the second nation to achieve this feat following their win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup."
FIFA World Cup Trophy_Eventual replacement,"Since the base of the trophy only has space for new engravings to be made up until the 2038 World Cup, a new trophy will eventually be made for the 2042 World Cup."

2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualification_Summary,"The 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualification was an international men's under-23 football competition which decided the participating teams of the 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup.
A total of 16 teams qualified to play in the final tournament, including Uzbekistan who qualified automatically as hosts country.Due to non-compliance to doping regulations, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Indonesia and Thailand from using their national flags in competitions, except during the Olympics. It was reported that Indonesia prepared the flag of its federation, in the event its team was barred from using the national flag."
2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualification_Draw,"Out of the 47 AFC member associations, a total of 42 teams entered the competition. The final tournament hosts Uzbekistan decided to participate in qualification. Their matches were not taken into account when calculating the group ranking and best second-placed teams among the groups.
The draw was held on 9 July 2021, 12:00 (UTC+5), in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The 42 teams were drawn into nine groups of four teams and two groups of three teams. For the draw, teams were divided into two zones:

West Zone: 23 teams from West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia, to be drawn into five groups of four teams and one group of three teams (Groups A–F).
East Zone: 19 teams from ASEAN and East Asia, to be drawn into four groups of four teams and one group of three teams (Groups G–K).The teams were seeded according to their performance in the 2020 AFC U-23 Championship final tournament and qualification (overall ranking shown in parentheses). The eleven teams which indicated their intention to serve as qualification group hosts prior to the draw were drawn into separate groups.
On 29 July, North Korea withdrew from the competition due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, to better balance of the number of teams across all groups, the AFC conducted a draw on 11 August to move one team from Groups G to J, which was Hong Kong, who were placed in Group K. On 11 October, China also withdrew from the competition for the same reason, leaving Group G with only two teams.

There are currently two awards voted on by fans after the conclusion of the tournament:
the Goal of the Tournament, (currently commercially termed ""Hyundai Goal of the Tournament"") for the fans' best goal scored during the tournament, first awarded in 2006;
the Most Entertaining Team for the team that has entertained the public the most, during the World Cup final tournament, as determined by a poll of the general public.
One other award was given between 1994 and 2006:an All-Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the FIFA Technical Study Group. From 2010 onwards, all Dream Teams or Statistical Teams are unofficial, as reported by FIFA itself."
FIFA World Cup awards_Golden Ball,"The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee (Technical Study Group) and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by Adidas and France Football. Oliver Kahn is to date the only goalkeeper to have won the award, which he did in the FIFA World Cup 2002. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Lionel Messi became the first player to win two Golden Balls."
FIFA World Cup awards_Unofficial winner,"The following players were recognised as best players by FIFA website. Also, FIFA only recognizes the 1978 Golden Ball award prior to 1982. FIFA does not recognize Golden Ball awards from 1930 to 1974."
FIFA World Cup awards_Media's selections,"Authoritative football historian and statistician Ejikeme Ikwunze, popularly called ""Mr. Football"", published a list of the best players in his book World Cup (1930-2010): A Statistical Summary, and it gained the most attention among experts' selections about the best players until 1978. This work is part of the official FIFA library, and received public recognition from his former presidents Joao Havelange and Joseph Blatter. A considerable number of other media agreed with him.
On 2 August 1950, Dr. Friedebert Becker, the editor-in-chief of Kicker (then Sport-Magazin), chose his best players of the tournament.France Football, the sponsor of Golden Ball and Ballon d'Or, selected the best player of the 1966 FIFA World Cup at that time with L'Équipe, and Bobby Charlton became the winner.After the 1978 World Cup Argentinian magazine El Gráfico held a survey for the best player of the tournament. This was different from the unofficial Golden Ball which is recognised by FIFA.Guerin Sportivo chose their top 10 player for the 1990 tournament in Italy.In 1998 the Argentinian newspaper Clarín provided a brief description of each star player dating back to 1930. Some are controversial decisions as is the case with retrospective awards. The 1998 winner was awarded after the tournament ended."
FIFA World Cup awards_Golden Boot,"The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982, under the name Golden Shoe. It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010. FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.If there is more than one player with the same number of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player with more assists. If there is still more than one player, the tie (since 2006) is decided by minutes played in the tournament, with the player playing fewest minutes ranked first. A Silver Boot and a Bronze Boot are also awarded for the second and third-highest goalscorers respectively."
FIFA World Cup awards_Golden Glove,"The Golden Glove award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name ""Lev Yashin Award"" in 1994, in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper. It was rechristened ""Golden Glove"" in 2010. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002."
FIFA World Cup awards_FIFA Young Player Award,"The FIFA Young Player Award (""Best Young Player Award"" 2006–2010) was awarded for the first time at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and given to Germany's Lukas Podolski. The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old.  For the 2022 World Cup, this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 2001.
In 2006, the election took place on FIFA's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group.FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the ""Best Young Player"" of the World Cup, between 1958 and 2002, named the best young player of each tournament. With 61% of the overall vote, the winner was Pelé, who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas, the best young player at Mexico 1970, and England's Michael Owen, who reached similar heights at France 98.The winner of the award has only been part of the winning country three times. Pelé in 1958, Kylian Mbappé in 2018, and Enzo Fernández in 2022."
FIFA World Cup awards_FIFA Fair Play Trophy,"The FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament since 1970. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.The appearance of the award was originally a certificate. From 1982 to 1990, it was a golden trophy based on Sport Billy, a football-playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play. Ever since 1994, it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure. Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico."
FIFA World Cup awards_Player of the Match,"The Player of the Match (POTM) award picks the outstanding player in every match of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name ""Man of the Match"" in 2002. It was rechristened ""Player of the Match"" in 2022.
While the inaugural two editions were chosen by the technical group, since 2010, Player of the Match is picked by an online poll on FIFA's website.

FIFA World Cup awards_Most Entertaining Team,"The Most Entertaining Team award is a subjectively awarded prize for the team that had done the most to entertain the public with a positive approach to the game, organised through public participation in a poll starting in 1994."
FIFA World Cup awards_Official winners,"The All-Star Team is a team of the best performers at the respective World Cup finals. Since 1994, FIFA decided to add official best squads, chosen by its Technical Study Group under the brand name MasterCard All-Star Team. For 1998, 2002 and 2006, substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full squads."
FIFA World Cup awards_Unofficial winners,"FIFA published the first All-Star Team in 1938, but it never made All-Star Team again until 1990 due to ensuing complaints. In January 1959, the host of 1958 tournament Swedish Federation published an All-Star Team based on 720 answers out of 1,200 experts. In 1990 there was an All-Star Team announced in combination with the Golden Ball ceremony. It was chosen by the same journalists who chose the best player, but this team is still considered unofficial.
After FIFA changed its sponsor from MasterCard to Visa in 2007, it published Team of the Tournament based on statistical data of other sponsors, which evaluates players' performances. FIFA explained these are not official.
Since 2010, the Fan Dream Team has been voted by online poll of FIFA website, but FIFA explained this is also not official team."
FIFA World Cup awards_Goal of the Tournament,"The Goal of the Tournament award was awarded for the first time at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Scores and results list the goal tally of the players' team first."
Taking the knee_Summary,"Taking the knee (or taking a knee) is a symbolic gesture against racism whereby an individual kneels upon one knee in place of standing to attention for an anthem or other such occasion. It was originated by American football player Colin Kaepernick on September 1, 2016, in protest against the lack of attention given to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. Kaepernick's protest led to a wider series of national anthem protests. It has since been adopted by sports players in countries around the world, including association football in the United Kingdom, in solidarity with Kaepernick's protest against racism, and has been seen worldwide in non-sporting contexts such as the Black Lives Matter protests."
Taking the knee_U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,"The gesture originated in a 2016 American football game, during which Colin Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid chose to kneel during the playing of the US national anthem, to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality.""After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest,"" said Reid. ""We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture.  I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.""During the 2016 season, a small number of other players also took the knee before matches. Taking a knee became more frequent after then-President Trump criticized the gesture during a rally in September 2017, describing it as a disrespectful act against the United States national anthem and flag, and urging NFL team owners to sack ""son of a bitch"" players who performed it. In response, over a hundred NFL players took the knee in subsequent weeks, along with athletes from other sports, and spectators."
Taking the knee_Use in association football,"Taking the knee was used by many clubs before kick-off throughout the 2020–21 English association football season, which was booed by some fans.In a June 2020 radio interview, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that he saw the gesture as ""a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation"", adding that he was unaware whether it had a broader history and that it seemed to him to be ""taken from the Game of Thrones"".In September 2020, Middlesbrough said they would stop taking the knee. In December 2020 players from Millwall and QPR said they would not take the knee, but would instead stand arm-in-arm. By February 2021 other teams had stopped taking the knee, including Brentford, while individual players from other teams such as Wilfried Zaha said they would also stop. Zaha later became the first Premier League player to stop taking the knee. Derby County stopped in March 2021.On June 8, 2021, prior to an international friendly game between Hungary and the Republic of Ireland, the Irish players were booed by some Hungarian fans prior to kick-off for taking the knee.

The England national team took the knee before matches in 2021's UEFA European Football Championship, resulting in booing from some fans. Conservative MP Lee Anderson stated that he would not watch England games in the tournament as a direct result of this political gesture, saying he believed that ""the vast majority of these fans booing last night are not racist"" and thought they were ""more likely to [...] not share the Marxist views of BLM"". Kick It Out's chief executive Tony Burnett considered the booing an example of racism in the sport. The English Football Association later asked fans to respect the players' wishes to take the knee. England players were booed by Poland fans for kneeling against racism ahead of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at National Stadium, Warsaw.In July 2021, Conservative MP Steve Baker said the Government should start backing players taking the knee, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel had declined to condemn those who booed. Keir Starmer, Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Labour Party, said England's players were ""right to take the knee"".Ahead of the 2022–23 Premier League season, Premier League club captains agreed to their teams no longer taking the knee routinely before matches, instead restricting the gesture to ""significant moments"" of the season. Some captains felt that the gesture had lost its power, and hoped that restricting it would increase its impact. Captains affirmed their commitment towards fighting racism and other forms of discrimination. During the national anthem to start the 2022 FIFA World Cup game between England and Iran, England players took the knee as Iran’s players fell silent in reaction to events going on in their country."
Taking the knee_Similar gestures in history,"Josiah Wedgwood pottered the image of a black man kneeling in shackles and depicting slavery on the emblem of the British abolitionist movement during the 18th and 19th centuries—a movement to ban slavery and ill-treatment of people.In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. knelt in prayer with a group of equalities marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches."
2022 FIFA World Cup officials_Summary,"The following is a list of match officials (referees, assistant referees, and video assistant referees) who officiated at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.FIFA appoints ten officials for each match of the tournament. This includes the on-site team of the referee, two assistant referees, the fourth official and the reserve assistant referee. At a centralised video operation room in Doha, the team of video match officials operate the video assistant referee (VAR) system. This team consists of the lead video assistant referee and three assistants, designated as the assistant VAR (AVAR1), the offside VAR (AVAR2) and the support VAR (AVAR3). Finally, a stand-by assistant VAR official is appointed for each match, used in case of a loss of connection between the stadium and the centralised video operation room. In such a scenario, a backup VAR room located in each stadium will be activated, with the fourth official serving as the video assistant referee (and the reserve assistant referee taking his place), and the stand-by assistant VAR serving as the assistant VAR.For the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Referees Committee has also appointed three female referees and three female assistant referees."
2022 FIFA World Cup officials_Referees and assistant referees,"On 19 May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees and 69 assistant referees from all six confederations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. These were selected from an extended list of over 50 trios.On 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Summary,"The decision for Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup created a number of concerns and controversies regarding both Qatar's suitability as a host country and the fairness of the FIFA World Cup bidding process. Some media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups have criticised Qatar's record of human rights violations; Qatar's limited football history; the high expected cost; the local climate; and alleged bribery in the bidding process. Not all nations competing have put focus on concerns.Criticism of human rights in Qatar focused on the treatment of migrant workers, women, and position on LGBT rights, leading to allegations of sportswashing. Others have cited Qatar's intense climate and lack of a strong football culture, as well as evidence of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption. Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players, while former FIFA President Sepp Blatter has twice said that giving Qatar hosting rights was a ""mistake"". Match attendance figures have also come under scrutiny as reported crowd attendances have exceeded stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.Incumbent FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended the hosting of the tournament in Qatar. Others have suggested that Qatar's human rights record is better than those of Russia and China, nations which received less widespread criticism for similar issues when hosting major sporting events in the years prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar have been described as a cultural conflict or ""Clash of Civilizations"" between authoritarian Islamic regimes and secular liberal democracies. The Qatari tournament is widely regarded as one of the most controversial FIFA World Cups in history."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Human rights issues,"There have been criticisms of perceived human rights violations related to the organisation and hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. There have long been concerns for the state of human rights in Qatar, with the state accused of sportswashing in hosting the World Cup. A large concern in Qatar's hosting of the World Cup was the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths. FIFA's decision drew overall criticism for Qatar's lack of human rights protections for women, migrant workers, lesbians, gay, bisexuals, transgender (LGBT) people, and journalists.
The state of women's rights, and a British tourism executive hired to promote Qatar dying under suspicious circumstances have also been sources of controversy. In a December 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, FIFA's secretary-general Fatma Samoura said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_LGBT issues,"Because of Islamic sharia law, there are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy. The security of fans, as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-coloured armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination; though not specifically in support of LGBT+ rights, nor targeting Qatar's lack, the rainbow symbol was deemed offensive to the hosts. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the European teams, FIFA told the teams that they would receive a yellow card as a minimum.Security officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing, flags featuring rainbows, whether Pride-related or not, and reportedly intimidated fans. American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Environmental impact,"Each stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch. With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated. The process damages the marine environment. Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels. As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage. The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised.One of the eight stadiums, Stadium 974, was designed to be able to be disassembled so that it could be moved elsewhere, in an effort to counter the negative effect of requiring upkeep of unused stadiums. The large PR campaign promoting this was criticised by activists, as it overlooked the other stadiums being constructed in Qatar. Stadium 974 and the organising committee pledge that the tournament would be carbon neutral were also criticised as attempts to greenwash Qatar, the nation with the highest per-capita CO2 emissions, especially as carbon neutrality was planned to be achieved by planting trees to offset emissions generated by the tournament, rather than use alternative energies. Stadium 974, located at a port, does not have air conditioning; due to the climate of Qatar, the other seven stadiums do, with the systems running on fossil fuels."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Corruption,"There have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee. There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_2011,"In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar. According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing. A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar. She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them. She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction. FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_2014–15,"In March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million. The Daily Telegraph reported that it understands that the U.S. FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.On 1 June 2014, The Sunday Times claimed to have obtained documents including e-mails, letters and bank transfers which allegedly proved that Bin Hammam had paid more than 5 million US dollars to Football officials to support the Qatar bid. Bin Hamman and all those accused of accepting bribes denied the charges.Later in June 2014, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by parties who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar, and that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup. He reiterated that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled""."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_FIFA ethics investigation report,"In 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence. At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015. FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar ""pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways"" but did not ""compromise the integrity"" of the overall bid process.Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately stating that the report is “materially incomplete” and with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"". In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg who claimed to have obtained the report wrote in a Facebook post that the report ""does not provide the proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought"" and stated that he would publish the full report bit by bit. This forced FIFA to release the original report as authored by the investigator Michael Garcia. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested rules of conduct to the limit. The report ended talks of a re-vote."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_2020,"In January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote. According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption. The Mail on Sunday asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as ""production contributions"" which were ""standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders"".According to leaked documents obtained by The Sunday Times, Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100 million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480 million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880 million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police.FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to The Sunday Times in an email and wrote ""allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. FIFA is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities."" A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not ""respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations.""Damian Collins, a British Member of Parliament (MP) and chairman of a UK parliamentary committee, called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launched an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract ""appears to be in clear breach of the rules"".Former UEFA president Michel Platini was arrested by French police on 18 June 2019 in relation to the rewarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. He was detained at the Anti-Corruption Office of the Judicial Police outside Paris. The arrest represents the first substantial public move in an investigation into the Qatar decision opened two years ago by France's Parquet National Financier, which is responsible for law enforcement against serious financial crime."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Scheduling,"The notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian). The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues. FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a ""blatant mistake"", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues.In October 2013, a taskforce was commissioned to consider alternative dates, and report after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In early 2014, FIFA Secretary-General Jerome Valcke appeared to preempt this, saying: ""Frankly, I think it will happen between November 15 and the end of December because that is when the weather is more favourable. It's more like springtime in Europe"". This was controversial within FIFA itself, due to a possible conflict with the Christmas season, and Vice-president Jim Boyce responded in saying that ""it absolutely has not been decided as far as the executive committee are concerned.It was agreed all the stakeholders should meet, all the stakeholders should have an input and then the decision would be made, and that decision as far as I understand will not be taken until the end of 2014 or the March executive meeting in 2015. As it stands it remains in the summer with no decision expected until end of 2014 or March 2015"".
Another option to combat heat problems was changing the date of the World Cup to the northern hemisphere's winter, when the climate in Qatar would be cooler. However, this proved just as problematic as doing so would disrupt the calendar of a number of domestic leagues, particularly in Europe.Franz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, said Qatar could be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup in winter. He justified his proposal on the grounds that Qatar would be saving money, which otherwise they would have spent in cooling the stadiums. Beckenbauer said: ""One should think about another solution. In January and February you have comfortable 25 °C (77 °F) there"". ""Qatar won the vote and deserves a fair chance as the first host from the Middle East"". At a ceremony in Qatar marking the occasion of having been awarded the World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter later agreed that this suggestion was plausible, but FIFA later clarified that any change from the bid position of a June–July games would be for the host association to propose. Beckenbauer would later receive a 90-day ban from any football-related activity from FIFA after refusing to cooperate in the investigation of bribery.The notion of holding the Cup during Europe's winter was further boosted by UEFA President Michel Platini's indicating that he was ready to rearrange the European club competitions accordingly. Platini's vote for the summer 2022 World Cup went to Qatar. FIFA President Sepp Blatter also said that despite air-conditioned stadiums the event was more than the games itself and involved other cultural events. In this regard, he questioned if fans and players could take part in the summer temperatures.In addition to objections by European leagues, Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said a change of the 2022 World Cup date from summer to winter would upset the schedule of the A-League and said they would seek compensation from FIFA should the decision go ahead. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.In September 2013, it was alleged that FIFA had held talks with broadcasters over the decision to change the date of the World Cup as it doing so could cause potential clashes with other scheduled television programming. The Fox Broadcasting Company who had paid $425 million for the right to broadcast both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the US, later voiced anger over the possible season switch, as doing so would clash with that year's NFL season, which takes place in the winter and with whom Fox also has a lucrative broadcasting deal. The network said they bought the rights with the understanding the tournament would take place in the summer, and if the change did go ahead they would seek compensation.In February 2015, FIFA awarded Fox the rights to the 2026 World Cup, without opening it up for bidding with ESPN, NBC, and other interested American broadcasters. Richard Sandomir of The New York Times reported that FIFA did so to avoid Fox from suing in U.S. courts, which under the American legal system could force FIFA to open up their books and expose any possible corruption. As BBC sports editor Dan Roan observed, ""It does not seem to matter to FIFA that rival networks ESPN and NBC may have wanted to bid, or that more money could have been generated for the good of the sport had a proper auction been held. As ever, it seemed, FIFA was looking after itself"".On 24 February 2015, it was announced that a winter World Cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event. The event was scheduled to be held between November and December. Commentators noted the clash with the Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern for how short the tournament was intended to be. It was also confirmed that the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations would be moved from January to June to prevent African players from having a relatively quick two-week turnaround, although the monsoonal rainy season in its host country Guinea starts about that time."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Climate,"As the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than 50 °C (122 °F). Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to Qatar Today magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would ""affect performance levels from a health point of view"" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that ""recovery times between games would be longer"" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, ""more mistakes would be made"". One of the doctors said that ""total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible"".The inspection team for evaluating who would host the tournament said that Qatar was ""high risk"" due to the weather. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially rejected the criticism, but in September 2013 said the FIFA executive committee would evaluate the feasibility of a winter event instead of a summer one."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Cost,"By some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion). This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure. Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans. A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament.According to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch, the investment banking division of Bank of America, the organisers in Qatar have requested from FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg.com said that Qatar wishes to cut the number of venues to 8 or 9 from the 12 originally planned. A report released in December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that Qatar's neighbours could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no specific countries were named in the report. Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA's executive committee. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to accommodate the people of the region during the tournament."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Possible Israeli qualification,"The head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel. Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Russian participation after its invasion of Ukraine,"After the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B. Also in Path B were Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden, all of which refused to play against Russia in any form (as did England, which had already qualified for the tournament).On 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team had been ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. They may not compete under the name, flag, or national anthem of Russia: similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics, the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (""RFU"") rather than ""Russia"". The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions ""until further notice"", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In July 2022, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed the Russian appeals and upheld FIFA's and UEFA's decisions.Some observers, while approving of the boycott of Russia, pointed out that FIFA did not boycott Saudi Arabia for its military intervention in Yemen, or Qatar for its human rights violations."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Qatari football record,"At the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, and had never qualified for the World Cup before. The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting. Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019. Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams). These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.
The Qatar Football Association has also been known to naturalise players from foreign nations for its own team. Examples include Sebastián Soria, Luiz Júnior and Emerson Sheik. The Qatar FA has previously attempted to offer incentives to uncapped players of other nations to switch allegiance to the Gulf state. These have included the German-based Brazilian trio of Aílton, Dedé and Leandro in 2004 – none of whom have ever played in or have other connections to Qatar – to help their team qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. FIFA blocked the moves and as a result, tightened eligibility requirements for national teams.With a 2–0 loss to Ecuador on the tournament's opening day, Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at the World Cup; Qatar subsequently lost 3–1 to Senegal in their second group match, becoming the first team to be eliminated from the tournament. They lost their final group game 2–0 to the Netherlands, becoming the first and only host to lose all their games, as well as the first host to finish 4th in their group and last overall."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Alcohol,"Hassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event. Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought. Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia.In February 2022, the communications executive director at the supreme committee, Fatma Al-Nuaimi, stated in an interview that alcohol would be available in designated fan zones outside stadiums and in other Qatari official hospitality venues. In July 2022, it was reported that while fans would be allowed to bring alcoholic beverages into the stadiums, alcoholic beverages would not be sold inside the stadiums. But according to a source, ""the plans are still being finalised."" However, on 18 November 2022, days before the first match, Qatar officially banned alcoholic beverages from sale within the eight stadiums.On 30 November 2022, The Times published an interview with some female fans attending FIFA World Cup 2022 games, with some of them saying that less drunkenness among other attendees made them feel safer at the stadiums than they expected."
"List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_""Focus on the football"" letter","On 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to ""respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world"" and to ""focus on the football"" as to ""not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists"". Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people. All of the nations criticised the letter, stating ""FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case. History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate."""
"List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_""Today I feel"" address","On 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol. He opened by declaring that he ""felt"" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated. He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because ""for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people"". Infantino argued that none of the European companies ""who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region"" had taken steps to address the rights of migrant workers like FIFA had, and suggested that Europe needed to be more open to accepting refugees and migrant workers. He asked, ""do we want to continue to spit on the others because they look different, or they feel different? We defend human rights. We do it our way. We obtain results. We got women fans in Iran. The Women's League was created in Sudan. Let’s celebrate. Don't divide."" In response to a last-minute prohibition on the sale of alcohol inside the stadiums, Infantino stated that it was a decision made jointly by FIFA and the organising committee, but argued that FIFA was still in ""200% control"" of the event, prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at sporting events were not exclusive to Qatar, and joked that ""if this is the biggest issue we have for the World Cup then I will resign immediately and go to the beach to relax"". He once again argued that people should ""focus on the football"", and direct their criticism to FIFA and ""me if you want"" instead of Qatar.The speech drew further criticism: The Associated Press labeled the speech an ""extraordinary diatribe"" and a ""tirade"" while The Guardian called it ""bizarre and incendiary"". Infantino was accused of deflecting criticism of Qatar's human rights record. Amnesty International criticised Infantino for ""brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms"", Sky Sports pundit Melissa Reddy accused Infantino of engaging in whataboutism, while FairSquare director Nicholas McGeehan described the remarks as being ""as crass as they were clumsy"", and feeling like ""talking points directly from the Qatari authorities"". Writing for The Observer, Barney Ronay described the address as being ""a wretched spectacle—not to mention myopic, tin-eared and oddly lost"", and felt that Infantino was ""clearly furious with his critics, furious that this thing cannot be bent to his will. And by the end it had become hugely engrossing just to see someone so blind to his own contortions, so shameless, and quite clearly losing his grip on his own spectacular."""
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Opening ceremony and anthem,"In the weeks before the tournament began, singers Dua Lipa and Shakira announced that they had refused to perform at the opening ceremony and collaborate on the tournament anthem due to human rights violations implemented by the Emirate's internal policies. British singer Rod Stewart said he turned down a substantial offer to perform in the country: ""They offered me a lot of money, more than a million dollars, to perform there [in Qatar]. I turned it down. It's not right to go there."" In addition, the league's ambassador, David Beckham, was criticized by the LGBT community in the United Kingdom for lending his face to the event in exchange for $10 million. Talking about the fact former Spice Girls member Melanie C, arguing that it is ""complex"" for sports to change culture when so much money is involved.  British singer Robbie Williams defended his choice to participate as a guest at the opening event, stating: ""I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere. But, that being said, if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known. [...] You get this microscope that goes 'okay, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them'... I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere"".After the announcement of the collaboration for the World Cup anthem ""Tukoh Taka"", performed by Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj, Colombian singer Maluma, and Lebanese singer Myriam Fares, the three artists have been affected by a great deal of controversy for choosing to be paid to sing a song in an Emirate whose internal policies involve the violation of human rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, as well as the support of slavery and child exploitation. Singer Maluma replied to the charge by declaring: ""it’s something I can’t resolve; [...] It’s not something that I actually have to be involved with. I’m here enjoying my music and the beautiful life, playing soccer too"".American actor Morgan Freeman was criticised on social media by media outlets for participating in the tournament's opening ceremony, with references made to his acting performance as Nelson Mandela in the dedicated film Invictus (2009)."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Iranian protests,"In October 2022, calls were made to ban the Iranian national team from the World Cup for the Iranian government's blocking of Iranian women from their stadiums, their supplying of weapons to Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, and the treatment towards protesters during the Mahsa Amini protests.Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the presence of Iranian women in Iranian stadiums had been illegal until October 2019 after the death of Sahar Khodayari, when select Iranian women were allowed to enter the stadium after 40 years for a World Cup qualifier. However, in March 2022, Iranian women were again banned from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier, with authorities using pepper spray to disperse them.Former Iranian national team goalkeeper Sosha Makani called on fans to either boycott the event or create slogans and chants that highlight the Iranian government's involvement of the deaths of protestors Nika Shakarami, Hadis Najafi, Asra Panahi and Sarina Esmailzadeh to prevent the government from using footage of them in the stands as propaganda, while ex-wrestling champion Sardar Pashaei called for a full ban of the national team until the government steps down.

In early November 2022, the Welsh government stated they would boycott the Group B Wales vs Iran match due to the protests in Iran.Ahead of the country's opening game (Group B England vs Iran match), many Iranians boycotted their team as they felt it was representing the government. Ahead of that opening game against England, the Iranian team refused to sing the national anthem in solidarity with the Mahsa Amini protests, with some Iranian supporters cheering against their own team or boycotting their team as a result.In the following match against Wales, amidst the boos and whistles from the Iranian supporters during the playing of the national anthem, the Iranian players were filmed singing the national anthem, with some protestors having their pre-revolutionary Lion and Sun flags and Women, Life, Freedom banners snatched from them by pro-government fans and stadium security at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. Security guards at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium seized a flag with the inscription ""Woman. Freedom. Life"" from an Iranian fan before the Group B game between Iran and Wales. Reuters reported on several incidents involving Iranian fans at this game, including a man wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words ""Women, Life, Freedom"" being escorted by three security officers into the ground, but was unable to confirm why he was being given a security escort, as well as a Reuters photograph which showed a woman whose face was painted with dark red tears holding a shirt in the air with ""Mahsa Amini - 22"" on it. Another Iranian fan told Reuters that her friends had been prevented from entering the stadium due to their efforts to bring t-shirts reading ""Women Life Freedom"" but that she had managed to get one t-shirt through the security blanket outside the stadium. Protesters were harassed by government supporters with some protesters being detained by Qatari police, while stadium security confirmed they were given orders to confiscate anything but the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Protesters against the regime covered the lenses of security cameras with sanitary pads. One Iranian fan said Qatari police insisted she wash away the markings on her arms and chest, which commemorated those who had been killed by Iranian security forces. Documents obtained by Iran International showed Iran was coordinating secret efforts with Qatar to control who attends the World Cup and restrict any signs of dissent.Prior to what would be Iran's final fixture (Group B Iran vs United States match), Iran's state-run media called for the US team to be expelled from the tournament after the US Soccer Federation removed the Islamic Republic emblem from Iran's flag in a social media post. The US Federation confirmed it had done so to show support for Iranian protesters before deleting the post. FIFA did not comment on the issue.Ahead of that concluding fixture against the United States, the Iranian players were reportedly called in to a meeting with members of the IRGC and threatened with violence and the torture of their families if they did not sing the national anthem or joined the protests against the Iranian regime. During the match, the Iranian players sang the national anthem again before losing to the United States 1–0 for the first time in their history, thereby being knocked out of the tournament. Many Iranians celebrated the defeat and one Iranian man was killed by security forces in Iran after honking his car horn in celebration. Another Iranian fan was arrested by Qatari police after he was wearing a shirt with the Woman, Life, Freedom slogan. Qatari police also stopped people from carrying the old Iranian flag and other banners."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Jewish and Israeli fans,"It was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities. Qatar alleged that they could not ""secure"" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.Multiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans. Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed. The Israeli government warned its citizens who are travelling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns. Moav Vardi of Kan 11 stated that Arab fan chants included, ""You are not welcome here, there is only Palestine, there is no such thing as Israel, Israel does not exist"", with some turning back when the Israeli reporters disclose that they're Jewish. Muslims and Morocco football team players also raised Palestinan flags during the matches."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Paid fans,"In 2020, Qatar began a fan engagement program promising to pay air travel, entrance tickets to matches, housing and even spending money for groups of fans from all competing nations. However, fans who are handpicked by the Qatari government are required to sing and chant when asked to, and are required to report any social media posts which are critical of Qatar. Many fans reportedly declined the offer. On 18 November 2022, it was reported that Qatar had cancelled the daily spending allowances for fans who were paid to attend the World Cup.Days prior to the start of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Qatar was accused of reportedly having paid actors to play the role of fans at the tournament in order to promote the country. Qatar was similarly accused of having paid for supporters when it hosted the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship.During the World Cup, Nejmeh SC ultras from Lebanon were employed by the Qatari government to act as Qatar national team fans during their games. The 1,500 ""adopted"" ultras wore maroon t-shirts with ""Qatar"" stamped on front, sang the Qatari national anthem and beat drums while singing chants."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Accommodation,"In the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners. This accommodation cost over $200 a night. A Greek salad which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no feta, served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable. These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated Fyre Festival. Alcohol, where available, is expensive, with beer being $13.73 for 500ml.One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match. People who had stayed in another village complained about the air conditioning and beds: ""It has been hell. The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a [fighter jet] is taking off.... [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.""Due to these issues, which Qatar officials say were caused by ""owner and operator negligence"", Qatar offered refunds to fans ""severely impacted"" by the issues."

List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Security interference,"Prior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials. Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's TV 2 was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village, who threatened him and attempted to break their camera. Tantholdt responded to the group, saying ""You have invited the whole world here. Why can't we film? It is a public place."" Organisers apologised for the incident, claiming that it was a mistake.RTÉ journalist Tony O'Donoghue accused Qatari police of stopping him during efforts to film in the country on 17 November.While the tournament was underway, Argentine television presenter Joaquín 'El Pollo' Álvarez was intercepted by heavy-handed Qatari forces while he was in the middle of a live TV broadcast in a street of Barwa Village, a complex in Doha specifically designed for Qatar's hosting of the tournament. Álvarez was interviewing an old supported in a wheelchair, when he was stopped by Qatari forces, who asked him if he was an accredited media representative. When he was searching for his press pass in his bag, an official became irritated and ordered the cameraman to stop filming, claiming that the street was ""private"". 
Álvarez said that the official threatened to arrest him, saying ""I was frightened and thought they were going to take me prisoner... It's impossible to work and enjoy a World Cup like this"".The film crew were also threatened with the destruction of their equipment. Nicolás Magali, who was co-hosting the live broadcast from the TV studio in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, told viewers: ""This is an example of severe censorship and we have to say so. They covered up the camera, didn't let us film, ordered you away in a rude fashion, and on top of that, the person doing the talking didn't identify himself""."

An outspoken critic of Qatar's selection as World Cup host, Wahl had been briefly detained while wearing a t-shirt depicting a rainbow at an earlier game during the tournament (United States vs Wales). Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, and his brother said he believes Wahl's death was the result of foul play, implicating the Qatari government as playing a role. Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he did not collapse but instead began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They have criticised the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl. In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene. An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture. Grant Wahl's brother later backtracked on his statement on the cause of his brother's death and stated he no longer suspects foul play."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Chinese censorship,"CCTV, the state broadcaster and the official broadcaster of FIFA World Cup in mainland China, replaced footage of maskless audiences with close-ups of coaches, officials or players, or birds-eye view of stadiums in its broadcast, as scenes of maskless audiences fueled unrest with China's zero-COVID policy during ongoing protests. Following the protests, the Chinese government began to relax pandemic control measures and more images of audience without masks appeared on live telecast."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Algerian censorship,"State-run TV2 of Algeria avoided coverage of the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match and Morocco's subsequent win, due to tensions between Algeria and Morocco. In addition, Algeria's state TV channel and the Algeria Press Service never mentioned Morocco's defeating Spain in the round of 16, although many Algerians celebrated Morocco's victory.Although the reason has not been revealed, a few hours after the result of Morocco defeated Portugal in the quarter-final was shown on TV3, the director general of Public Establishment of Television, Chabane Lounakel was dismissed by the Algerian government."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Western media coverage perceived as racist,"Middle East Eye, a web news portal understood to be funded and operated by Qatar, though the nation denies this, has described several Western media publications as racist, and criticised the nations from which they originate.

After this, he was criticized for discrimination against Asians especially among Japanese people in Germany.E-newsletter Morocco World News criticised Danish television network TV 2, which it said was racist for a panel of presenters comparing the way Moroccan players reached over spectators to embrace their mothers to monkeys huddling, while the blog site Al Bawaba saw someone post criticism of Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant for printing on the day of their semi-final, a cartoon of Morocco players with shaved heads taking the World Cup trophy from Infantino."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_BBC controversies,"Hassan Al Thawadi, the head of the Qatar World Cup, called some of the BBC's coverage of the tournament ""extremely racist"" and charged Gary Lineker with not engaging with the organisers before criticising them directly. The BBC said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about its coverage of the World Cup opener between hosts Qatar and Ecuador, and some users described the BBC's coverage of the World Cup as ""racist"".
Al Thawadi said since February, he had tried several times to have a meeting between the officials organising the World Cup and the hosts and pundits of the BBC, especially Lineker, but there was never any desire to listen to the Qatari side of the story. He claimed that Lineker never wanted to engage. In response to Al Thawadi, Lineker tweeted that he and his representative had not received any requests to engage with anyone involved in Qatar 2022. The Daily Telegraph reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April. A BBC spokesperson denied Al Thawadi's claims and said they had a duty to cover legitimate issues related to the World Cup without fear or favour. Lineker would go on to end his commentary of the tournament by stating that the United States, one of the co-hosts of the following World Cup, is “extraordinarily racist” in an attempt to show that he was willing to criticise any host country and had not only singled out Qatar for its issues while also mentioning that “every country has problems”.On 19 November 2022, Jürgen Klinsmann, accused Iran of cheating in their 2–0 win over Wales whilst appearing as a pundit on the BBC. He stated that cheating in football matches is in Iranian culture.

First, in the 65th minute, Xhaka grabbed his crotch in the direction of Serbian players, causing the entire Serbian bench to angrily respond to him and Serbian reserve goalkeeper Predrag Rajković being booked. Second, at the end of the match, Xhaka got into a fight against Nikola Milenković for his chants against Serbians, with both players going into the referee's book.Many Serbian fans displayed slogans and attire related to the Yugoslav Wars, such as ""Serbia to Tokyo"", and made racist chants and gestures toward Albanians during the second half of the game. Between the two incidents between Xhaka and the Serbian players, FIFA issued a public address in the 77th minute of the game asking for ""discriminatory chants and gestures"" to stop. Also, according to a Kosovo Albanian fan, his Albanian flag around his neck was confiscated at the entrance before the game. Another fan was escorted out of the game by members of security after doing the Albanian double-headed eagle celebration.Furthermore, Xhaka, an ethnic Albanian, enraged Serbian fans by wearing a jersey with the surname of Jashari written on it while celebrating after having won the match. Despite his claims that he wore the jersey to show support to his young Switzerland teammate Ardon Jashari, Serbian fans and media interpreted the move as glorification of Adem Jashari, a Kosovo Albanian soldier who founded the Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War, and who is seen as a national hero amongst Albanians but as a terrorist amongst Serbs.FIFA later opened a disciplinary proceeding against Serbia over the breach of three of FIFA's articles, including misconduct of players, discrimination, and order and security at matches."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Croatian incidents,"Xenophobic chants were reported during the course of the Group F Croatia vs Canada match on 27 November. During the match, Croatian fans chanted xenophobic anti-Serb slogans against Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan, an ethnic Croatian Serb who fled Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence. They also displayed a modified John Deere banner making a reference to Operation Storm, a military operation that ended the war and abolished the separatist proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina, which resulted in a mass exodus and war crimes against number of Krajina's Serb civilians. Serbs generally consider it an act of ethnic cleansing, however, in a controversial decision, the ICTY appeals court in the 2012 final verdict ruled that ""there had been no joint criminal enterprise, or conspiracy, to force out the Serbs from the Krajina region."" Borjan's phone number was leaked among Croatian fans who sent him over 2,500 hateful messages during and after the game. His wife was also insulted during the game and targeted with hateful massages on social platforms just like him.The incident was also preceded by Borjan's statement that he was ""born in Krajina"" and ""not Croatia"", while characterizing the historical Croatian region of Dalmatia as Serbian which Croatians considered a nationalist and irredentist claim. Republika Srpska Krajina was a separatist state created by Croatian Serbs in 1991 where ethnic cleansing of Croats was carried out.FIFA opened a disciplinary measure against Croatia over these incidents after the Canadian Soccer Association filed a complaint. On 7 December, the Croatian Football Federation was fined 50,000 Swiss francs due to violating article 16 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.FIFA hit Croatia with another fine of 5,000 Swiss francs for the inappropriate behaviour (use of banners with inappropriate content) before the match against Morocco, played on 17 December."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Pitch invasions,"A pitch invader, carrying a rainbow flag and wearing a shirt with the words “RESPECT FOR IRANIAN WOMAN” written on the back and “SAVE UKRAINE” written on the front, interrupted the Group H Portugal vs Uruguay match on 28 November.Another person interrupted the Group D Tunisia vs France match on 30 November by running into the pitch carrying a Palestinian flag."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Japan goal versus Spain,"In the Group E Japan vs Spain match, on 1 December, Japan midfielder Ao Tanaka scored a controversial goal (his team's second), the ball ending up in Unai Simón's net shortly after it seemed to have gone out of play. After a lengthy delay the goal was eventually awarded by VAR. The decision proved critical in both Japan's surprise topping of Group E and the elimination of Germany from the tournament, with Die Mannschaft finishing third despite securing a two-goal victory over Costa Rica in the group's other game. An image was later released showing that the ball had not fully crossed the line, by the narrowest of margins. Qatari-owned network beIN Sports showed a virtual bird's eye view of the ball: the section of the ball which was in contact with the pitch was outside the field of play, but its curvature meant the side of the ball was still marginally over the line. Spain's coach Luis Enrique claimed that the image had been ""manipulated"". On December 3, FIFA released video and images to provide an official explanation to show that the VAR decision was correct."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Netherlands vs Argentina quarter-final,"Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz officiated the second quarter-final, held on 9 December, a game between the Netherlands and Argentina. Mateu Lahoz's decision-making throughout this game was called into question by many of those involved, as well as by neutral observers. BBC presenter Gary Lineker at one point during the game commented: ""13 yellow cards. This referee has always loved to be the centre of attention. Makes Mike Dean seem shy."" Ultimately, Mateu Lahoz produced a FIFA World Cup record of 18 yellow cards, including to people who were sitting on the bench and thus not involved in the game. After the end of the game, Mateu Lahoz issued a red card to Netherlands player Denzel Dumfries, however no TV commentator picked up on this, leaving viewers who checked the match reports afterwards puzzled. During the extra time period (which resulted from Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst scoring an equalising goal with the last kick of normal time, which itself went on for ten minutes extra due to the number of stoppages), BBC commentator Martin Keown remarked: ""I think the referee is losing the plot here.""Earlier, and with Argentina giving up a two-goal lead to leave the score at 2–2, Argentina's Leandro Paredes fouled his opponent Nathan Aké. Paredes responded to the referee's whistle by angrily kicking the ball at the Dutch bench on which staff and players were seated. Enraged Dutch staff and players poured onto the pitch, followed by Argentine staff and player, sparking an on-pitch brawl featuring players and substitutes. Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk was seen charging forward and knocking Paredes to the ground. Given the general confusion surrounding the game's total of yellow cards and several contradictions when various match reports are viewed, it is unclear how many players Mateu Lahoz booked in this one incident.
After the game Lionel Messi asked FIFA to expel Mateu Lahoz. Messi also criticised the Netherlands manager: ""Louis van Gaal says they play good football, but what he did was put tall people and spam long balls"" and blamed Mateu Lahoz for causing the game to go on longer than it should have: ""The referee sent us into extra time"". The referee's decision not to show the yellow card to Messi for a deliberate handball also attracted comment, though Messi was eventually booked in the 10th minute of injury time at the end of the second half, at which point he would have been sent off with a red card if he had been booked for the earlier foul. Argentina's goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez described Mateu Lahoz as ""crazy, the worst referee of the tournament, he is arrogant. You say something to him and he talks back to you badly. I think since Spain went out [to Morocco in the Round of 16] he wanted us to go out as well"".Before Argentine player Lautaro Martínez started walking to kick his penalty shot, several Dutch players started to surround him, in an attempt to psych him out, even though a player is supposed to go to kick the shot alone. He would later go on to score Argentina's decisive shot, that qualified them to the semifinals. Immediately following the penalty shootout victory, several Argentina players goaded the losing Netherlands players, e.g. Nicolás Otamendi raised his hands behind his ears, Leandro Paredes and Gonzalo Montiel gestured directly at them, while Alexis Mac Allister, Germán Pezzella and Ángel Di María screamed at their beaten opponents, action harshly shunned by some foreign commentators and claimed as misunderstood by some others. However, the next day, an overhead camera recorded the incident between Martínez and the chasing Dutch players.Messi, while giving a post-match interview, said to Wout Weghorst: ""What are you looking at, fool? Go away, go back there."""
"List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_""No Surrender"" Kosovo flag","Shortly after the Group G Brazil vs Serbia match on 24 November, a flag showing Kosovo as being part of Serbia with words ""Нема предаје"" (transl. No surrender) was seen hanging in Serbia's locker room. The flag was also displayed by fans during the game. The Football Association of Kosovo sued the Football Association of Serbia and urged FIFA to open an investigation.  On 26 November 2022, FIFA opened proceedings against the Football Association of Serbia due on the basis of article 11 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and article 4 of the Regulations for the FIFA World Cup 2022. The Football Association of Serbia was subsequently fined 20,000 Swiss francs by FIFA on 7 December."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Moroccan riots,"Following the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match, in which Morocco unexpectedly defeated Belgium on 27 November, Moroccan fans began to riot in the Belgian cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege, and in the Dutch cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and The Hague. At least twelve people were detained and two police officers were injured. Riot police attempted to break up a group of 500 football supporters in Rotterdam while media reported unrest in Amsterdam and The Hague.Following the semifinal match between Morocco and France, clashes erupted between Moroccan and French fans in several French cities, with one 14-year-old boy being killed in Montpellier. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, 14 Moroccan fans were arrested in the city of Rotterdam amidst the unrest, while Dutch officials opted against public screenings of the game due to the previous unrest from the Morocco vs Belgium match."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Uruguayans after Ghana game,"The Group H Ghana vs Uruguay match on 2 December finished in a 2–0 victory for Uruguay; however, Uruguay failed to progress from the group. After the final whistle, several Uruguayan players confronted the referee and other FIFA officials over what they deemed as controversial decisions during the course of the game, and while walking down the tunnel towards the dressing rooms, Edinson Cavani pushed over the VAR monitor.After the tournament ended, FIFA banned 
Fernando Muslera and José María Giménez for four international games each and was ordered to pay a fine of €20,000. Meanwhile, Edinson Cavani and Diego Godín must serve one international game bans each and must pay a fine of €15,000. All four players are also ordered to take part in a form of community service. The Uruguayan football federation was also fined €43,800 and will have to play one home fixture with a reduced capacity. The punishments received are reminiscent of the one that Luis Suárez received in 2014 after biting an opponent."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Samuel Eto'o assault,"Following the Group G Cameroon vs Brazil match on 2 December, Samuel Eto'o assaulted a man outside Stadium 974. A video circulated on social media of the former Cameroon international and Barcelona player, who was Cameroonian Football Federation president, attacking the man. Eto'o said himself, in a statement issued later that week, that it was a ""violent altercation"", that it was ""an unfortunate incident"" and that his victim was ""probably"" a fan of Algeria."
List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies_Argentina–France final,"After Argentina's win in the final, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani presented an Arab cloak, a bisht, to Lionel Messi. In Qatar, using a bisht traditionally display a high status, used by royals. Some people criticised the gesture, saying it marred the moment when Messi lifted the World Cup; BBC host Gary Lineker said it was ""a shame they've covered his shirt"" during ""a magic moment"".  However, fan and media reactions were mixed, with some commentators describing journalists who criticised the bisht presentation as salty.Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, after winning the Golden glove trophy (which resembles a giant hand), placed it on his groin and pointed towards fans in front of the FIFA president and Qatari Emir, which some detractors saw as a vulgar gesture.Turkish celebrity Salt Bae was seen on the pitch, intruding to talk to the Argentine players, despite the clear discomfort of the players around him. He was also behaving inappropriately around the World Cup trophy and taking medals from the Argentines to bite into it."
2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group A_Summary,"The 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification UEFA Group A was one of the ten UEFA groups in the World Cup qualification tournament to decide which teams would qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup finals tournament in Qatar.

Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_Summary,"The 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match between Canada and Mexico was an association football match contested by the Canadian and Mexican men's national soccer teams during the third round of CONCACAF's 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament. Canada's victory over Mexico ended Mexico's eleven match unbeaten streak against Canada dating back to August 15, 2000, and put Canada in first place of the qualifying group. The temperature at kickoff was recorded as −9° Celsius, making it the coldest match ever played by the Mexico national team."
Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_Venue selection,"Canada was scheduled to be the home team for the seventh and eighth fixtures of the qualifying group, and the Canadian Soccer Association chose to host their matches in Edmonton, Alberta, a city renowned for very cold Prairie winters. This strategy was often used by both Canada and the United States to create a disadvantage for the Mexican team, as those players would not be used to playing under such frigid conditions. These cold conditions caused Canadian fans and eventually Canada Soccer to nickname Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton as the ""Iceteca"" or ""Estadio Iceteca"" which was a play on words of the Estadio Azteca, Mexico's home stadium. Several fans would later refer to the match as the Battle of the ""Iceteca""."
Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_Background,"Canada and Mexico had faced each other twice before in 2021. Mexico was able to beat Canada 2–1 in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup semi-finals, defeating them with a winning goal in the 90+9th minute of the match scored by Héctor Herrera. Mexico had also hosted Canada earlier in October for a World Cup qualifying match which ended in a 1–1 draw at the Estadio Azteca. Mexico were in second place of the group, tied with first place USA with fourteen points, while Canada trailed by one point in third place. Both teams had the opportunity to rise to the top of the group if they could come away with a win.
Table as of November 12, 2021"
Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_First half,"The first half quickly became a hostile affair, with both sides carrying over the bitterness from the recent fixtures. A particularly hard challenge in the first couple minutes of play left Mexican forward Hirving Lozano down for several minutes as the foul count continued to grow. As tensions rose, both managers were cautioned after half an hour for complaints towards the referees and each other. Canada were able to find the opening goal in first-half stoppage time after Cyle Larin was able to tap in a rebound after goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa mistakenly fumbled the ball from a long shot by Alistair Johnston."
Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_Second half,"Seven minutes into the second half, Canada would double their lead when Mexico failed to defend a Stephen Eustáquio free kick which landed in the goal area for Larin to tap in. During the goal celebration, Canadian defender Sam Adekugbe made headlines after celebrating in true Canadian fashion by jumping into a snow bank which had developed near the corner of the pitch. This goal was Larin's twenty-second goal for the Canada men's national team, and equaled the team's top scoring record held by Dwayne De Rosario. Both sides continued to get stuck in and frustrations started to boil over near the end as Mexico desperately attempted to find equalizing goals. Mexico would eventually find the net in the ninetieth minute of play, when Hector Herrera was able to head in a cross from the right and half the deficit. This was quickly followed by a skirmish in front of goal as Mexican players attempted to swipe the ball from goalkeeper Milan Borjan, whom had immediately pounced on the ball to delay the restart as the match entered stoppage time. With increased motivation to equalize, Mexico unleashed several promising attacks throughout additional time, most notably in the third additional minute when the Canadian defense failed to clear away a cross and gave away a shot from two yards out. However, Borjan was able to make a goal line save, prompting several protests from Mexican players who believed the ball was over the line. Canada attempted to kill the last couple seconds of the game by holding the ball in the corner, causing an angered Néstor Araujo to recklessly shoulder charge Lucas Cavallini from behind. The referee issued a yellow card for the challenge before ending the match."
Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_Reactions,"Canada's three points from the match would cause them to surpass the United States and take first place, a position that they would maintain for the rest of the tournament. In Canada, this match was seen by many as a turning point for Canadian soccer and the men's national team, whose normal reputation of being an underdog team in international competition with little prestige or potential, were now being proclaimed as the 'Kings of CONCACAF.' A staggering forty-four thousand fans turned up in sub-zero temperatures to watch the match, which in Edmonton was the national team's third highest attendance record, only sitting below the forty-eight thousand who showed for the match against Costa Rica four days earlier, and the fifty-two thousand people who attended a friendly against Brazil in 1994. Canada would eventually qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1986. Despite the loss, Mexico would eventually reach second place and qualify as well for the seventeenth time in their history."
Canada v Mexico (2022 FIFA World Cup qualification)_2022 World Cup,"Despite their successful qualifying campaign, Canada was only able to qualify for Pot 4 of the World Cup draw, and were placed in a challenging group with Belgium (the 2nd ranked country in the world), as well as Croatia and Morocco who would both eventually reach the semi-finals. Mexico despite qualifying for Pot 2 were also matched with difficult opposition in Poland, the eventual World Cup champions Argentina, and Saudi Arabia. 
Canada were able to shock the world in their fourth ever World Cup match by putting up an incredible fight against Belgium, but were unable to find their first points at the World Cup due to a missed penalty-kick and poor finishing in an eventual 1–0 loss. Despite being praised by the international press, and the Belgian coaching staff, Canada would be defeated by Croatia and Morocco, and exited their second World Cup with two goals and no points.
Mexico's run was relatively unsuccessful as well. They managed to hold Poland to a 0–0 draw thanks to a penalty-save from Ochoa, however, their 2–0 loss to Argentina put them in a difficult position on the final matchday. Despite coming away with a win against Saudi Arabia, a 90+5th minute consolation goal for the Saudi Arabian national team eliminated Mexico on goal differential."

2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs)_Draw,"The play-off draw took place on 14 October 2022, 12:00 CEST (UTC+2), in Zürich, Switzerland. Four teams were seeded into groups based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings of 13 October 2022 (shown in parentheses), with a maximum of one seeded team per confederation. The UEFA team was automatically seeded into pot 1, so as to prevent three European teams from being drawn into the same group in the final tournament. The highest-ranked team was placed in slot A1, the second-highest in slot B1, the third-highest in slot C1 and the fourth-highest in slot C2. The remaining six teams were unseeded and drawn into the remaining slots, with the condition that teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group.

Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Summary,"Australia submitted an unsuccessful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On 2 December 2010 FIFA announced that the event would be held in Qatar. Australia also lodged a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but withdrew the bid on 10 June 2010. The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup. The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson."
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Schedule,"After decades of hypothesising Australia's credentials to host the FIFA World Cup, the Howard Government welcomed tentative investigations into the viability of hosting the tournament as early as 2002. Football Australia, known at the time as Soccer Australia, targeted bidding for the 2014 edition of the tournament. After realising that Brazil were overwhelmingly likely to receive the hosting rights - which they did in 2007 - Football Federation Australia focused on a formal bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, announcing their intention to do so in November 2007. After FIFA in December 2008 announced they would be accepting bids for both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup, Australia registered their intention to bid with FIFA for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in February 2009.
The bid was officially launched on 14 June 2009 at Parliament House in Canberra."
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Rejected bid venues,"The following is a list of stadiums that were considered at one time as part of the FFA's bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final cut:"
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Ground sharing issues,"Of the Australian stadiums that meet FIFA's seating criteria, none are primary association football venues. They are predominantly cricket, Australian rules football and rugby league playing venues. At the proposed time of the World Cup during the northern hemisphere summer, these facilities are normally in regular season use by Australian rules football and the rugby codes. Former England international, Peter Withe, now living in Australia, observed that ""... there are some great stadiums in Australia but a lot of them are Aussie rules arenas. These are not great for the round ball.""The need for all World Cup stadia to be used only for World Cup games prior to and during the World Cup caused controversy with the Australian Football League, and National Rugby League, who claim that loss of access to almost all their major venues for eight weeks would severely disrupt their seasons and even impact the viability of their clubs. The AFL advised it would not give up Docklands Stadium in Melbourne, and the management of Docklands Stadium (which includes the AFL as part owners of the venue) ruled out use of the stadium for the bid. The use of these shared venues remains the only option for the bid, with the Australian authorities unwilling to invest massive amounts of money in new association football-only stadia. The development of Kardinia Park (Skilled Stadium) in Geelong has been proposed to replace the loss of Docklands Stadium in the FFA bid, following the World Cup the stadium would be reconfigured to a larger oval for AFL use. Compensation claims for the disrupted seasons of the local codes may run into several hundred million dollars. The AFL and NRL and possibly also the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) will lobby for equity from government.
The AFL, NRL and FFA announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 9 May 2010, guaranteeing the AFL and NRL seasons will continue, should the bid be successful, and compensation for the other football codes may be awarded as a result of any disruptions caused by hosting the World Cup.The seasons for Australia's football codes are as follows:

""Q"" denotes pre-competition qualifiers
""S"" denotes the start of the regular-season.
""P"" denotes playoff(s)/postseason/knockout stages.
""F"" denotes Final(s)."
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Cost concerns and benefits,"Several stories in the Australian media question the restrictions and privileges that FIFA will demand of host cities at taxpayer expense, in addition to the need to build and improve so many stadia or whether ""mega-events"" like the World Cup are cost-effective. The FFA has argued that these costs are overstated.A report conducted by McKinsey consultants on behalf of FIFA, rated an Australian World Cup to be the worst in term of revenue. The United States were rated at 100%, Japan 73%, South Korea 71%, Qatar 70%, and Australia on 68%.A study by global research firm IBISWorld claimed that the 2022 World Cup would be worth $35.5 billion to the Australian economy – four times the amount generated by the 2000 Sydney Olympics."
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Government support,"Australia's bid has received government support from an early stage, with former-Prime Minister John Howard announcing federal and state/territory government support before FFA announced their intention to bid.Bid Chairman Frank Lowy AC announced at the bid launch that he has the personal commitment of the then-Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who announced the Federal Government's support for the bid in February 2008. In December 2008, Federal minister for sport Kate Ellis announced that the federal government would give Football Federation Australia $45.6 million to fund its World Cup bid preparation. Leader of the Opposition Malcolm Turnbull affirmed the support of the Opposition on 11 December 2008 and again at the formal launch of the bid in June 2009.Rudd met with Sepp Blatter to discuss the Federal Government's support of the bid in Zurich in July 2009.On 23 December 2009, with concerns over costs and effects of the bid upon other sporting codes, the Federal Government established a task force to take over much of the communication lacking by the bid in Australia. The taskforce will negotiate with governments regarding responsibility for stadium improvements, new facilities and financial guarantees. It will also organise and clarify ground-sharing arrangements with other sports and possible compensation for loss of venues."
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Bid website,"Australia's bid website was launched 14 June 2009 and contained bid information as well as being a social media platform where users could share content and connect with each other.
At the launch, FFA chairman Frank Lowy AC said the people of Australia were its ""secret weapon"" to snaring the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cup and encouraged the public to join the Association football-themed social networking web site. The public campaign was the first bid for a major event driven almost entirely by social media. Actress Nicole Kidman, actor Hugh Jackman, model Elle Macpherson and sports stars Ian Thorpe (swimming), Liz Ellis (netball), Mark Webber (Formula One) and Steve Waugh (cricket) joined to help promote the bid."
2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)_Summary,"The North, Central American and Caribbean section of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification acted as the qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, to be held in Qatar, for national teams which are members of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). Three direct slots and one inter-confederation play-off slot in the final tournament were available for CONCACAF teams."
2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)_Original format,"On 10 July 2019, CONCACAF announced a restructured qualifying format for the World Cup. After CONCACAF initially announced in March 2018 that they would use the CONCACAF Ranking Index to determine the seeding of CONCACAF teams for qualifying to international tournaments, it was determined that FIFA Rankings would be used instead.

Top-seeded Hexagonal group: The top 6 ranked CONCACAF teams based on the FIFA rankings of June 2020 were to play home-and-away round-robin matches in one single group (often referred to as the ""Hexagonal""). The top three teams would have qualified for the World Cup, and the fourth-placed team would have advanced to the CONCACAF play-off round.
Lower-seeded group stage and knockout stage: The remaining CONCACAF teams (ranked 7 to 35 based on the FIFA rankings of June 2020) were to be divided into eight groups (five groups of four teams and three groups of three teams) to play home-and-away round-robin matches.

If this bid was successful, Korea would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host Japan. Despite recent tensions, Han Sung-joo, chairman of the bid committee hoped to involve North Korea if South Korea received the bid."
Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Summary,"The Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the first official bid from the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) to host the FIFA World Cup. FIFA rejected the bid for lack of government support on 19 March 2010. Indonesia was one of four Asian countries bidding to bring the tournament to Asia for a second time, the 2002 tournament having been played in Japan and South Korea. Indonesia, under the name of the Dutch East Indies, had been the first Asian nation to compete in the World Cup, when they participated in the 1938 event, and they lost to Hungary in the first round."
Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Bid committee,"The chairman of the bid committee was Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the chairman of the Indonesian senate, and the vice chairman was Gita Wirjawan from Pertamina, a national oil and gas company.

The bid itself was used by Jusuf Kalla in his campaign to gain support for his presidential candidacy in 2009, though his effort was unsuccessful."
Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Bid rejection,"Indonesia was alone among the bidding nations in not having official government backing, although some support was offered in a 2009 interview by previous Youth and Sports Minister, Adhyaksa Dault.

Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Summary,"The Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was a successful bid by Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. With a population of 2 million people, Qatar was the first Arab state to host the World Cup. Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, son of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani the then Emir of Qatar, was the chairman of the bid committee.
Qatar promoted their hosting of the tournament as representing the Arab World, and has drawn support from across the member states of the Arab League. They also positioned their bid as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab World and the West.In November 2010, Qatar hosted a friendly match between Brazil and Argentina.Former president of FIFA Sepp Blatter endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Arab World, saying in April 2010: ""The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organize the tournament"". Blatter also praised Qatar's progress: ""When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the Asian Games (in 2006) with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question"".  On the 2nd of December 2010, it was announced that Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup."
Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Climate,"Working against the Qatar bid was the extreme temperature in the desert country. The World Cup always takes place during the European off-season in June and July. During this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar exceeds 40 °C (104 °F), the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30 °C (86 °F).  In response to this issue, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, has stated, ""the event has to be organized in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well""."
Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Proposed stadiums,"The first five proposed stadiums for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. The stadium will employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20°C (36°F), and the upper tiers of the stadium will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.The Air Conditioning in the stadiums for both the players and spectators will be solar powered, carbon neutral and provided by Arup of England.The Al-Khor Stadium is planned for Al-Khor city, located 50 kilometres north of Doha. The stadium will have a total capacity of 45,330, with 19,830 of the seats forming part of a temporary modular upper tier. The Al-Wakrah stadium, to be located in Al-Wakrah city in southern Qatar, will have a total capacity of 45,120 seats. The stadium will also contain a temporary upper tier of 25,500 seats. The stadium will be surrounded by large solar panels and will be decorated with Islamic art. The Al-Wakrah and Al-Khor stadiums would have been built regardless of whether Qatar was awarded the World Cup, according to the bid committee. However, the temporary upper-tier sections would not have been added if Qatar had lost the right to host the tournament."
Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Bribery,"During May 2011, bribery on the part of two members of the FIFA Executive Committee were tabled by Lord Triesman of the English FA. These allegations were based on information from a whistleblower involved with the Qatari bid. FIFA has since opened an internal inquiry into the matter, and would consider a revote on the 2022 World Cup if the allegations were proven.  Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter conceded in 2011 that there was widespread support to re-hold the 2022 vote won by Qatar.In testimony to a UK parliamentary inquiry board in May 2011 Lord Triesman alleged that Trinidad and Tobago's Jack Warner demanded $4 million for an education center in his country and Paraguay's Nicolás Léoz asked for an honorary knighthood in exchange for their votes.  Also, two Sunday Times reporters testified that they had been told that Jacques Anouma of the Ivory Coast and Issa Hayatou of Cameroon were each paid $1.5 million to support Qatar's bid for the tournament.  All four have denied the allegations.  Mohammed bin Hammam, who played a key role in securing the games for Qatar, withdrew as a candidate for president of FIFA in May 2011 after being accused of bribing 25 FIFA officials to vote for his candidacy. Both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended by FIFA in wake of these allegations, with Warner reacting to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke had also told him that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup. Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had ""used its financial muscle to lobby for support"".
Qatar officials denied any impropriety and insist that the corruption allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by those who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that ""The country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup and that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy"".According to leaked documents seen by The Sunday Times, Qatari state-owned television channel Al Jazeera (now beIN Sport) secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100 million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480 million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880 million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 world cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police. FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to The Sunday Times in an email and wrote “allegations linked to the Fifa World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by Fifa, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. Fifa is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities.” A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not “respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations.”"
Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Human rights and the conditions of migrant workers,"A major element of controversy pertaining to the 2022 FIFA World Cup has been the use of migrant labor in constructing Qatar's several new stadiums for the tournament. Human rights organization Amnesty International has criticized Qatar's treatment of migrant workers and argued in a 56-page report that Qatar has failed to investigate, remedy and prevent the deaths of these workers, subjecting them to inhumane, unhealthy and dangerous conditions while also underpaying them and in some cases preventing them to leave. However the measures, which became enforceable on August 30, 2020, introduced a mandatory minimum wage of 1,000 Qatari riyal (roughly $275 USD) per month and made it easy for migrant workers to switch jobs before the end of their contracts without first requiring a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from their employer. Employers must give workers a living wage or provide allowances to cover these costs in addition to the raised minimum wage for everybody. All this was revealed in a report published by the Human rights watch. In their article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, ""We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.""The football associations of several countries qualified for the tournament have taken stands against these alleged human rights violations, and teams such as the Netherlands and Germany have made symbolic protest actions to show their disapproval.Responding to the allegation that as many as 6,500 migrant workers may have died as the result of inhumane labour conditions, representatives from Qatar's labor ministry have stated that ""no other country has come so far on labour reform in such a short amount of time, but we acknowledge that there is more work to be done"". After a thorough investigation, the International Labour Organization, claimed the figures ""misleading"" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022 via reported drafted by France24. The country did successfully reimbursed US$320 million to wage abuse victims through the Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022.Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country. She praised ""the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar."""
Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Extreme climate,"The World Cup is usually held in the northern hemisphere summer. During this season in Qatar, the temperature can get to 50 °C (122 °F). Qatar says that this will not be a problem for it hosting the World Cup. A section from Qatar 2022 Bid official site explains:

""Each of the five stadia will harness the power of the sun's rays to provide a cool environment for players and fans by converting solar energy into electricity that will then be used to cool both fans and players at the stadia. When games are not taking place, the solar installations at the stadia will export energy onto the power grid. During matches, the stadia will draw energy from the grid. This is the basis for the stadia's carbon neutrality. Along with the stadia, we plan to make the cooling technologies we’ve developed available to other countries in hot climates, so that they too can host major sporting events"".An example of this occurred during the 2018 World Cup qualifier with China under air conditioning, which happened on 8 October 2015.
Such cooling techniques will be able to reduce temperatures from 45 to 25 degrees Celsius (113 to 77 °F), which would be comfortable for players and spectators during matches, the bid also proposes these cooling technologies to be used in fan-zones, training pitches and walkways between Metro stations and stadia.
But if anyone enters an area without this technology, they may still be exposed to extreme levels of heat.
Qatar declared their intention to change the dates of the World Cup to winter immediately upon being award the Cup because of all the controversy surrounding the topic."
Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Alcohol,"Alcohol can currently be consumed legally in hotel bars and clubs by showing a passport for reporting and a special permit to attend the club. The question of whether alcohol was allowed to be consumed in additional areas and at the games themselves was asked, Hassan Abdullah al Thawed, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the World Cup. Qatar's bid promised that beer would be permitted at stadia, but this promise was reneged just days before the first game. A few specific fan-zones were set up during the event, that would provide alcohol for sale. Also certain bars were developed for all the tourists coming to support their chosen teams in the World Cup."

Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Summary,"The Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the second official bid from the Japan Football Association or the JFA. Had this bid been successful (the bid was won by Qatar), Japan would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host South Korea, becoming the sixth nation to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil and (West) Germany. On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association Bid team decided to concentrate solely on winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup."
Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_3D and holographic simulcasts,"Japan pledged that if it had been granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop technology enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in 3D, which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time.  Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being in the presence of the players.  Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.Japan's bidding team has enlisted pioneering technology scientist Jun Murai of Keio University in their plans to host the games.  The country demonstrated holographic display technology at the 2009 NAB Show using integral cameras (sometimes referred to as 8K) and wavefront reconstruction, and Murai has stated that Japan could develop the means for the necessary technologies to be realized by 2016.  Murai and committee managing director Takato Maruyama have stated they are confident that the endeavor is feasible.  The event would be co-organized with South Korea.In addition to projection, ""translation earpieces"" would be available to allow fans of different nations to converse with each other. Devices would also be available which would allow people to instantly capture information about players by pointing at them."
Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid_Industry ramifications,"If Japan had been awarded the 2022 World Cup, providing it with the initiative to realize the proposed technologies, it could drive private companies to develop them as well, in order to stay in competition in the industry, resulting in accelerated development of the medium. Maruyama expressed his belief that with the advent of such technologies, public viewings at stadiums would increase attendance there by several ten-fold."

Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Summary,"There have been criticisms of perceived human rights violations related to the organisation and hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. There have long been concerns for the state of human rights in Qatar, with the state accused of sportswashing in hosting the World Cup.A large concern in Qatar's hosting of the World Cup was the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths. The state of women's rights, and a British tourism executive hired to promote Qatar dying under suspicious circumstances have also been sources of controversy.
In a December 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, FIFA's secretary-general Fatma Samoura said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Kafala system,"One of the most discussed issues of the Qatar World Cup was the treatment of workers hired to build the infrastructure. Most Qatari nationals avoid doing manual work or low-skilled jobs. They are given preference in the workplace. In May 2014, Qatar announced plans to abolish the kafala system, but implementation was delayed until 2016, and even if the promised reforms are implemented, employers would still have considerable power over workers (for example, a proposed requirement that wages must be paid into a designated bank account would not cover labourers paid in cash).Human Rights Watch and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) state that the kafala system leaves migrants vulnerable to systematic abuse. Workers could not change jobs or even leave the country without their sponsor's permission. In November 2013, Amnesty International reported ""serious exploitation"", including workers having to sign false statements that they had received their wages in order to regain their passports. An investigation by The Guardian in the same year claimed had their identity papers taken away from them, were compelled to perform forced labor, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them effectively slaves. The Guardian also reported that companies refused to pay salaries and administer necessary worker ID permits, rendering the workers illegal aliens and forcing them to stay. The report stated that there was evidence to suggest that workers face exploitation and abuse as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO).By 2015, Michael van Praag, president of the Royal Dutch Football Association, requested the FIFA Executive Committee to pressure Qatar over the allegations to ensure better workers' conditions. He also stated that a new vote on the attribution of the World Cup to Qatar would have to take place if the corruption allegations were to be proved. In March 2016, Amnesty International accused Qatar of using forced labour, forcing the employees to live in poor conditions, and withholding their wages and passports. It also accused FIFA of failing to act against the human rights abuses. Migrant workers told Amnesty about verbal abuse and threats they received after complaining about not being paid for up to several months. Nepali workers were denied leave to visit their family after the 2015 Nepal earthquake.In August 2022, Qatari authorities arrested and deported over 60 migrant workers who protested about non-payment of wages by their employer, Al Bandary International Group, a major construction and hospitality firm. Some of the demonstrators, from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Egypt and the Philippines, had not been paid for seven months. London-based labour rights body Equidem said most were sent home. Qatar's labour ministry said it was paying Al Bandary workers and taking further action against the company - already under investigation for failing to pay wages.In September 2022, Amnesty published the results of a poll of over 17,000 football fans from 15 countries which showed 73% supported FIFA compensating migrant workers in Qatar for human rights violations. FIFA responded with a statement noting progress on Qatar's migrant worker policies, adding ""FIFA will continue its efforts to enable remediation for workers who may have been adversely impacted in relation to FIFA World Cup-related work in accordance with its Human Rights Policy and responsibilities under relevant international standards.""On 24 November 2022, during the tournament, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requesting FIFA to help compensate the families of migrant workers who died in Qatar, and for Qatar conduct a full human rights investigation. Before the tournament was over, several individuals involved in the European Parliament had been arrested on charges of colluding in organised crime with Qatar, including aiming to improve Qatar's human rights reputation ahead of the World Cup."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Labour reforms,"In October 2017, the ITUC said that Qatar had signed an agreement to improve the situation of more than two million migrant workers in the country. According to the ITUC, the agreement provided for substantial reforms in the labour system, including ending the kafala system, and would positively affect the general situation of workers, especially those working on 2022 FIFA World Cup infrastructure projects. The workers would no longer need their employer's permission to leave the country or change their jobs. Amnesty International have questioned whether Qatar would complete the promised labour reforms before the start of the World Cup, a sentiment that FIFA backed. Amnesty International found that abuses were still occurring despite the nation taking some steps to improve labour rights. Law No. 13 of 2018 abolished exit visas for about 95 per cent of migrant workers. On 30 April 2018, the ILO opened its first project office in Qatar to monitor and support the implementation of the new labour laws. In February 2019, Amnesty International said Qatar was falling short on promised labour reforms before the start of the World Cup, a sentiment that FIFA backed. Amnesty also found that abuses were still occurring. In May 2019, an investigation by the UK's Daily Mirror newspaper discovered that some of the 28,000 workers on the stadiums were being paid 750 Qatari riyals per month, equivalent to £190 per month or 99 pence an hour for a typical 48-hour week. In October 2019, the ILO said that Qatar had taken steps towards upholding the rights of migrant workers.In April 2020, the government of Qatar provided $824 million to pay the wages of migrant workers in quarantine or undergoing treatment for COVID-19. In August 2020, the Qatari government announced a monthly minimum wage for all workers of 1,000 riyals (US$275), an increase from the previous temporary minimum wage of 750 riyals a month. The new laws went into effect in March 2021. The ILO said ""Qatar is the first country in the region to introduce a non-discriminatory minimum wage, which is a part of a series of historical reforms of the country's labour laws,"" but the campaign group Migrant Rights said the new minimum wage was too low to meet migrant workers' need with Qatar's high cost of living. In addition, employers are obligated to pay 300 riyals for food and 500 riyals for accommodation, if they do not provide employees with these directly. The No Objection Certificate was removed so that employees can change jobs without consent of the current employer. A Minimum Wage Committee was also formed to check on the implementation. These reforms removed the kafala system and a contractual system was introduced – the European Union's Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2021 noted Qatar's labour law reforms had incorporated non-discriminatory minimum wage systems and removal of the Kafala system in 2021.At the March 2022 FIFA Congress in Doha, Lise Klaveness—head of the Norwegian Football Federation—criticised the organisation for having awarded the World Cup to Qatar, citing the various controversies surrounding the tournament. She argued that ""in 2010 World Cups were awarded by FIFA in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality, democracy: the core interests of football were not in the starting XI until many years later. These basic rights were pressured onto the field as substitutes by outside voices. FIFA has addressed these issues but there's still a long way to go."" Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of Qatar 2022, criticised her remarks for ignoring the country's recent labour reforms. In May 2022, Amnesty accused FIFA of looking the other way while thousands of migrants worked in conditions ""amounting to forced labor"", arguing that FIFA should have required labour protections as a condition of hosting. Apart from all the condemns, in an article on August 11, 2022 published by the LA Times, it was revealed that Qatar used the focus of the month-long tournament for bringing more progress to its migrant sector. “Human Rights Watch acknowledges and applauds the reforms the Supreme Committee has put in place,” said Minky Worden, the New York-based advocacy group’s director of global initiatives. Also, in a report published by ILO in November 2022, it was revealed that a new dedicated department for Occupational Health and Safety within Qatar’s Ministry of Labour is being created and it will focus on prevention of accidents at work and compliance of laws to protect workers along with overall betterment of the whole sector.Shortly before the tournament began, France 24 broadcast a report titled ""The plight of migrant workers in Qatar"", adding more details to the controversy and how many reform laws have not been followed."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Conditions of migrant workers,"The issue of migrant workers' rights attracted greater attention once the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, with the 2013 investigation by The Guardian claiming that many workers were denied food and water.After visiting a labour camp in 2012, Sharan Burrows of the ITUC stated that ""If two years on [since the award of the 2022 World Cup] the [Qatari] Government has not done the fundamentals, they have no commitment to human rights"". The Qatar 2022 Committee said: ""Our commitment is to change working conditions in order to ensure a lasting legacy of improved worker welfare. We are aware this cannot be done overnight. But the 2022 FIFA World Cup is acting as a catalyst for improvements in this regard."" A video shown to labour rights groups in 2013 showed men living in dilapidated labour camps under unsanitary conditions.In November 2017, the ILO started a three-year technical cooperation programme with Qatar to improve working conditions and labour rights. Qatar introduced new labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights: Law No. 15 of 2017 introduced clauses on maximum working hours and constitutional rights to annual leave."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Deaths of migrant workers,"The Guardian estimated that, by the time the competition would be held, without reforms of the kafala system, out of the 2 million-strong migrant workforce up to 4,000 workers could die due to lax safety and other causes. These claims were based upon the fact that 522 Nepalese workers and over 700 Indian workers had died since 2010, when Qatar's bid as World Cup's host had been won, about 250 Indian workers dying each year. The Indian government said the number of deaths could be considered quite normal based on the figure of half a million Indians working in Qatar.The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2015 the ITUC's claim that over 1,200 workers had died while working on infrastructure and real-estate projects related to the World Cup, and the Qatar Government's counter-claim that none had. The BBC later reported that this often-cited figure of 1,200 workers having died in World Cup construction in Qatar between 2011 and 2013 is not correct, and that the 1,200 number is instead representing deaths from all Indians and Nepalese working in Qatar, not just of those workers involved in the preparation for the World Cup, and not just of construction workers.In 2019, the Planning and Statistics Authority of the State of Qatar reported that 15,021 non-Qataris had died between 2010 and 2019 in its Vital Statistics Annual Bulletin - Births & Deaths 2019.In February 2021, another investigative report published by The Guardian used data from embassies and national foreign employment offices to estimate a death toll of 6,500 migrant workers since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar. The figures used by The Guardian did not include occupation or place of work so deaths could not be definitively associated with the World Cup construction programme, but ""a very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup.""In a September 2021 report, Amnesty criticised Qatar for failing to investigate migrant workers' deaths."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Interactions with foreign companies,"In 2015, a crew of four journalists from the BBC were arrested and held for two days after they attempted to report on the condition of workers in the country. The reporters had been invited to visit the country as guests of the Government of Qatar. At the start of the tournament, the BBC refused to broadcast Qatar's 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, instead showing a panel discussion led by host Gary Lineker delivering a critique of Qatar's records on LGBT rights and treatment of migrant workers. Jim Waterson of The Guardian commented that the Qatari authorities ""probably hoped [the opening ceremony] would be the moment when the global media finally focused on football rather than human rights"".In March 2021, Hendriks Graszoden, the turf supplier for the 2006 World Cup and for the European Championships in 2008 and 2016, refused to supply Qatar with World Cup turf. According to company spokesperson Gerdien Vloet, one reason for this decision was the accusations of human rights abuses.On September 28, 2022, Danish sportswear company Hummel unveiled Denmark's ""toned down"" kits for the tournament in protest of Qatar's human rights record. One of these kits includes a black alternate kit that represents ""the color of mourning"", which references the dispute between Hummel and World Cup organisers in Qatar in which Hummel claimed that thousands of migrant workers died during the construction of the venues. Hummel said in their statement on their official Instagram:

With the Danish national team's new jerseys, we wanted to send a dual message. They are not only inspired by Euro 92, paying tribute to Denmark's greatest football success, but also a protest against Qatar and its human rights record. That's why we've toned down all the details for Denmark's new World Cup jerseys, including our logo and iconic chevrons. We don't wish to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of people their lives. We support the Danish national team all the way, but that isn't the same as supporting Qatar as a host nation. We believe that sport should bring people together. And when it doesn't, we want to make a statement.Singer Dua Lipa denied speculations that she would be performing in Qatar, stating in her Instagram Stories post that she looked ""forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made when it won the right to host the World Cup."" Rod Stewart, meanwhile, claimed he had refused over $1 million to perform at the tournament."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Defenses of Qatar and FIFA,"In March 2022, FIFA president Gianni Infantino claimed in an interview that the Gulf nation is being progressive in terms of the labour rights and migrant rights issues that prevailed previously, adding ""I am pleased to see the strong commitment from the Qatari authorities to ensure the reforms are fully implemented across the labour market, leaving a lasting legacy of the FIFA World Cup long after the event, and benefiting migrant workers in the host country in the long term.""In a news conference preceding the tournament on 19 November 2022, Infantino defended criticism of Qatar from the West as hypocritical, stating that ""I think for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people."" He asked, ""how many of these European companies who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region—billions every year—how many of them have addressed migrant worker rights? I have the answer: none of them, because if they change the legislation it means less profits. But we did. And FIFA generated much, much, much less than any of these companies, from Qatar.""Amid popular criticism, political commentary magazine The Economist also provided a defence for FIFA's choice, stating that Qatar was ""a more suitable country to host a big sporting event"" than both China and Russia, who hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup respectively, and who both have arguably worse human rights records. Moreover, it added that ""Western criticism"" failed to ""distinguish between truly repugnant regimes and merely flawed ones"", and that many ""indignant pundits"" simply sounded as if they did ""not like Muslims or rich people""."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Death of Marc Bennett,"Marc Bennett was a British travel advisor who died under mysterious circumstances in Doha. Bennett was employed by the Qatar Airways company Discover Qatar to promote the image of Qatar following the nation's selection as the host of the World Cup. After leaving the job and showing interest in a rival Saudi company, Bennett was arrested and tortured. He was found hanged in his hotel room on 25 December 2019. Following his death, Qatar Airways reported that he was arrested for stealing company secrets. The Qatari authorities said that he killed himself, Qatar Airways said this was unrelated to his work because he was a popular and valued former employee. Bennett's family dispute both stories; a British coroner did not record the death as suicide."
Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Women's rights,"Discrimination against women was also criticized. Women in Qatar must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.In February 2022, a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee working as an economist was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape. However, the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case against the Organizing Committee employee was dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar. Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision to close the case."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Summary,"Group A of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 20 to 29 November 2022. The group consisted of host nation Qatar, Ecuador, Senegal and the Netherlands. The top two teams, the Netherlands and Senegal, advanced to the round of 16. Qatar became the first host nation to lose every group game in the World Cup history, becoming the worst performing host."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Standings,"In the round of 16:

The winners of Group A, the Netherlands, advanced to play the runners-up of Group B, the United States.

However, FIFA adjusted the match schedule on 11 August 2022, moving the Qatar–Ecuador fixture to 20 November in order for the hosts to feature in the opening match of the tournament. As a result, Senegal–Netherlands fixture was pushed back to 19:00 on 21 November."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Qatar vs Ecuador,"The two teams had faced each other three times, most recently in 2018, a 4–3 win for Qatar in a friendly game. This was their first competitive meeting.
Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes, but eventually won 2–0 with a brace by Enner Valencia in the first match of the tournament. Valencia opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a penalty, shooting low to the right corner after being brought down in the penalty area by Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al-Sheeb. He scored his second in the 31st minute with a downward header to the left corner of the net after a cross in from the right by Ángelo Preciado. This is the third consecutive FIFA World Cup in which a player scored a brace in the opening match, after Brazil's Neymar in 2014 and Russia's Denis Cheryshev in 2018. This was also the first time a penalty kick had been scored as the opening goal of a FIFA World Cup. Qatar became the 14th debutant to lose their opening fixture; additionally, they became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Senegal vs Netherlands,"The teams had never met before.
After a goalless first half, Cody Gakpo put the Netherlands ahead in the 84th minute when he got to the ball first to head past the advancing goalkeeper Édouard Mendy and into the empty net after a cross from Frenkie de Jong. In stoppage time, Davy Klaassen made it 2–0 when he followed up on Memphis Depay's saved shot to slot into the net."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Qatar vs Senegal,"The two teams had never met before.

Mohammed Muntari pulled a goal back for Qater in the 78th minute when he scored with a header to the left corner after a cross from Ismaeel Mohammad on the right. Bamba Dieng scored a third for Senegal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot to the net after a pass from Iliman Ndiaye on the right.Following the Netherlands' 1–1 draw with Ecuador played after this match, Qatar became the first host country to be eliminated from the group stage of the FIFA World Cup after just two games, and the second overall, after South Africa, to fail to progress to the knockout round. This loss also confirmed Qatar as the worst hosts by performance, as they could secure no more than three points, one short of South Africa's four."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Netherlands vs Ecuador,"The two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2014, a 1–1 draw in a friendly game. In the 6th minute Cody Gakpo cut inside and shot left-footed to the left corner of the net from just outside the penalty area to put the Netherlands in front. Four minutes into the second half Enner Valencia scored his third goal of the tournament to make it 1-1 when he followed up the rebound after Andries Noppert had saved a shot from Pervis Estupiñán."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Ecuador vs Senegal,"The two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2005, a 2–1 win for Senegal in a friendly.
In the 44th minute, Ismaïla Sarr was fouled in the penalty area by Piero Hincapié with Sarr scoring the resulting penalty low to the right corner. In the 67th minute Moisés Caicedo made it 1-1 when he finished the ball low to the net from close range after it reached him from a corner on the right from Félix Torres.
With twenty minutes to go Kalidou Koulibaly put Senegal back in front with a right-foot volley from six yards out after the ball came to him after a free-kick from the right. It was his first ever goal for Senegal.Ecuador's loss led to being eliminated from the Group Stage for a second time, the first being in 2014."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Netherlands vs Qatar,"The two teams had never met before.
In the 26th minute Cody Gakpo scored his third goal of the tournament to put the Netherlands in front when he cut in from the left to score with a right-foot finish to the bottom right corner of the net from just inside the penalty area. Frenkie de Jong made it 2-0 four minutes into the second half when he followed up to poke into the net from close range after Meshaal Barsham had saved a shot from Memphis Depay.
In losing to the Netherlands, Qatar are the first World Cup hosts in history to suffer three defeats and failed to earn a single point."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group A_Discipline,"Fair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:
first yellow card: −1 point;

LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Summary,"There are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Public displays of affection,"As early as 2010, concerns have been raised about the rights of members of the LGBT community who attend the tournament, since homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. After Qatar was chosen as host, Sepp Blatter, the then-president of FIFA, was criticised for apparently jokingly telling a reporter inquiring about these concerns that gay attendees ""should refrain from any sexual activities"". In apology for the statement, Blatter assured that FIFA did not tolerate discrimination, and stated that ""[FIFA] don't want any discrimination. What we want to do is open this game to everybody, and to open it to all cultures, and this is what we are doing in 2022.""The Human Rights Watch reported that Qatar has arbitrarily arrested LGBT people and subjected them to ill-treatment in detention. The Gay Times reported that while Muslims can be sentenced to death for homosexuality under Sharia law, there have been no known cases of the death penalty being enforced for homosexuality in Qatar.In 2013, Hassan al-Thawadi stated that everyone would be welcome at Qatar 2022, but warned against public displays of affection because they were ""not part of our culture and tradition"". The Qatar organising committee seemed to retract this in September 2022, when Football Association (the FA; England's federation) chief executive Mark Bullingham said there had been assurances that LGBT couples would not face arrest while holding hands or kissing in public in Qatar. However, shortly before the tournament commenced, former Qatar international player and World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman described homosexuality as a ""damage in the mind"" in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF, which led to further criticism, including from the German government. The interview was cut short following the comments; Salman later said that his comments had been misrepresented by news agencies."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Rumours of homosexuality medical test,"After rumours and allegations that Qatar would introduce ""medical screening tests"" to ""detect"" and ban homosexuals from entering the country, LGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell said that ""FIFA now has no option but to cancel the World Cup in Qatar"". However, no such screening test exists. It was later revealed that this proposal came from Kuwait and, while involving other nearby nations, did not involve Qatar."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_FIFA defence and legacy in football,"In a news conference on the day before the opening match, confronting renewed criticisms that LGBT+ fans felt unsafe, FIFA president Gianni Infantino continued to defend that ""everyone who comes to Qatar is welcome, whatever religion, race, sexual orientation, belief she or he has, everyone is welcome. This was our requirement and the Qatari state sticks to that requirement"", and argued that anti-LGBT laws ""exist in many countries in the world"", and ""existed in Switzerland [where FIFA is based and Infantino was raised] when they organised the World Cup in 1954.""The BBC published a report based on interviews with LGBT+ fans from Qatar and from Western nations in December 2022. It looked at the effect that the attitude of the organising committee and FIFA (particularly Infantino) towards LGBT+ rights in preparation for and during the World Cup had on fans' feelings and views of football culture and homosexuality in football. Many fans reflected that they had previously felt that the footballing world was at or approaching a positive and supportive place in terms of accepting LGBT+ fans and players. The British attitude noted in the BBC report was that fans considered LGBT+ people being treated equally to be an uncontroversial matter of fact, and a fundamental human right, with fans having become used to seeing overt support from the footballing world. By instead seeing FIFA allow LGBT+ rights to revert to a debate, and one based on culture rather than human rights, during the World Cup, these fans were shocked; the BBC also noted that there was shock at Infantino repeatedly saying that people who wanted FIFA to condemn Qatar's stance on LGBT+ rights were only trying to stir a culture war.It concluded that the legacy of the Qatar World Cup would be to set back LGBT+ acceptance in football, discouraging LGBT+ fans from feeling that they have a place. The attitude of FIFA, suggesting that it will not support LGBT+ rights as ""divisive"", was said by the report to make football seem more hostile to LGBT+ players; it quoted Finnish women's footballer Linda Sällström ironically asking what FIFA would do to the numerous openly gay female players set to compete at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup if an armband with implicit awareness of homosexuality had been enough to warrant punishment in 2022."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Promotion of LGBT rights in Qatar,"In January 2022, openly gay Australian footballer Josh Cavallo suggested he would support the World Cup happening in Qatar if it could cause laws to be changed, describing this possibility as ""a fantastic opportunity"" for the nation, having previously expressed fear of travelling to the nation before the organising committee told him he would be welcome.In October 2022, Human Rights Watch called on FIFA to press Qatar to launch reforms that protected LGBT people after a Qatari official denied that there were cases of LGBT people beaten in jail. Qatari officials also rejected allegations that there were conversion therapy centers in Qatar.The openly queer BBC Sport television pundit Alex Scott reported throughout the World Cup in Qatar, saying ahead of the opening match that there were people who had suggested she stay at home, but she had instead wanted to use the platform of being at the World Cup to highlight and address the issues, which she did on several occasions."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Joe Lycett stunt,"On 13 November 2022, a week before the tournament was due to kick off, British comedian Joe Lycett released a video criticising David Beckham for his lucrative sponsorship deal promoting the World Cup, due to the country's stance on LGBT rights. In the video, Lycett promised to give £10,000 to charities that support queer people in football if Beckham pulled out of the deal. If Beckham did not pull out of the deal, he said he would shred the money during a livestream on 20 November, just before the opening ceremony. After the deadline passed with no response from Beckham or his representatives, Lycett broadcast such a livestream; it was later revealed that this was a ruse, with Lycett saying that he had donated the money to charity, having had no intention from the start of destroying money."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_OneLove armband,"Several European captains – those of England, Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands – were planning to wear OneLove armbands, which feature a multi-colored design and the phrase ""OneLove"". This was intended ""to promote inclusion and send a message against discrimination of any kind"". Widely seen as tacit support of the LGBTQ+ community, some felt it targeted Qatar's anti-LGBT laws. FIFA, who impose a fine on teams who wear unofficial armband designs at the World Cup, did not immediately comment on the issue. On 21 November, after the tournament had started but before any of the European nations had played, however, the relevant football associations were told the players would receive yellow cards if they wore the armband. It was later revealed by the Danish Football Association (DBU) that FIFA had not planned to tell the European teams of the potential punishment for wearing the OneLove armband; that the FA called FIFA to their team hotel for an emergency meeting on 21 November, the day of England's first match; and that at this meeting FIFA told the collected teams that a yellow card would be the ""minimum"" punishment for wearing the armbands, with other possibilities including banning the captains altogether.FIFA were criticised by fans and the football associations for forcing captains to choose between representing their countries and using their voice, with the Pride in Football LGBTQ+ supporters group also criticising the players for not doing so anyway, saying: ""A token gesture from the start that has turned into another embarrassment from FIFA. FIFA have had since September to sort this, and yet they wait until now to threaten sanction. Fifa is denying players their fundamental and most basic human right to freedom of speech. Countries, teams and players are happy to defend LGBTQ+ people until they themselves are at risk. LGBTQ+ Qataris face a bigger punishment than just a yellow card. The gestures and the activism ended quite easily at the thought of reprimand.""There were multiple incidents relating to LGBT symbols in Group B matches, with the United Kingdom and United States (England, Wales, and the US were all in Group B) governments also criticising FIFA for introducing player punishment for the armbands. Later in the week, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney criticised the world football governing body in his country's parliament, describing it as ""absolutely extraordinary"" that FIFA not only took the decision to ban the armbands, but kept changing their reason as to why, including shifting the blame by saying it was because of other national teams. Coveney also said: ""That is a political intervention by FIFA to limit freedom of expression, which is worthy of significant mention and criticism."" In the media, British newspaper Metro changed its website logo to a rainbow to protest the FIFA decision. Alex Scott wore the armband pitch-side before the England vs Iran match. Scott had earlier (during the opening ceremony, which the BBC elected not to broadcast, holding a studio panel discussion of Qatar controversies instead) criticised Infantino for a rambling speech in which he, in a seeming attempt to downplay the controversies of the tournament, claimed he understood what gay people in Qatar (among other minorities) felt like because he had experienced discrimination before.On 22 November, the German Football Association (DFB) announced that they were taking legal action against FIFA for the decision, submitting a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The German team played their first match the next day, and covered their mouths with their hands during their team photo as a protest against FIFA, signalling that they had been silenced. Qatari television hosts later mimicked the gesture when Germany were eliminated from the World Cup in the group stage, seen to be mocking the campaign. The FA, England football's governing body, also announced they were exploring legal options, saying that it understands World Cup rules would only administer a fine for kit violations and that FIFA may be attempting to enforce IFAB rules, which could allow them to implement other sanctions and which England believe should not apply to the World Cup, instead.On 23 November, the DBU, as well as revealing FIFA's threat of significant player punishment, confirmed that they and other UEFA teams were discussing a blanket withdrawal from FIFA, and said that they would not support the reelection of Infantino as FIFA president while they were still members. On the same day, a Danish TV 2 reporter wearing a OneLove armband while broadcasting from outside a stadium was approached by security officials, who told him to remove the armband and tried to block the camera.Fans began buying OneLove armbands after the ban and according to Badge Direct, who produce the armbands, they were sold out by 24 November. In response, FIFA allowed teams to wear the official ""no discrimination"" armbands intended for the quarter-finals during the group stage."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Other team items,"On 21 November, FIFA rejected Belgium's away jerseys due to the word ""Love"" being on the inside of the collar, even though it was unrelated to any campaign supporting LGBT rights.The United States included a rainbow in their team branding, replacing the red stripes in their logo with differently-coloured ones to create a Pride rainbow, but only used this for facilities used by the team, not on their jerseys. The Football Association of Wales said they would not withdraw from FIFA over the armband ban, but were otherwise heavily critical and put up rainbow flags at their outdoor training grounds in protest."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Rainbow flag confiscations,"On several occasions the Qatari organisers promised to comply with FIFA rules on promoting tolerance, including LGBT issues. In December 2020, Nasser Al-Khater, the Qatar World Cup chief executive, assured that, in accordance with FIFA's inclusion policy, it would not restrict the display of pro-LGBT imagery and symbols (such as rainbow flags) at matches during the World Cup, saying: ""When it comes to the rainbow flags in the stadiums, FIFA have their own guidelines, they have their rules and regulations, whatever they may be, we will respect them.""However, in April 2022, a senior security official overseeing the tournament stated that there were plans to confiscate pride flags from spectators, claiming it to be a safety measure to protect the fans from altercations with spectators that are anti-LGBT. Fare network criticised the report, arguing that actions against the LGBT community by the state were of a greater concern to those attending the World Cup than the actions of individuals.A Brazilian journalist had his phone seized by authorities when people mistook a flag representing his state, Pernambuco, which includes a rainbow within a larger design, for an LGBT flag. Other Brazilian fans from the region reported similar incidents of having flags taken from them because of the rainbow."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Group B,"US journalist Grant Wahl was detained for half an hour, before the United States' opener against Wales. He was wearing a black shirt with a rainbow on the front. He was told his shirt was not allowed due to it being ""political"". After 25 minutes, a security commander allowed him into the venue and apologised, and he also received an apology from a representative of FIFA. Wahl later passed away from an aortic rupture secondary to an aortic aneurysm on 10 December while reporting on a match in Qatar.Female Wales fans and Football Association of Wales (FAW) staff (including former Wales women's football captain Laura McAllister) had rainbow bucket hats, produced by the FAW, confiscated at the same game. The FAW said they were ""extremely disappointed"" and they would be raising the incidents with FIFA the following day; FIFA subsequently opened talks about rainbow apparel with Qatari officials on 22 November.According to BBC reporter Natalie Perks, she and a cameraman were prevented from entering Al Bayt Stadium ahead of the England vs United States Group B game on 25 November because the cameraman was found to have a rainbow-decorated watch and strap in his possession, which had been gifted to him by his son. Perks said they were eventually permitted entry to the stadium after dialling a number aimed specifically at media personnel to help them if they encountered difficulties. According to The Guardian, a reporter for The Times newspaper was questioned at the same stadium around the same game because of a wristband they were wearing."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Other matches,"Despite FIFA reassuring fans that rainbow coloured apparel would be allowed inside the stadium after the Group B incidents, Qatari officials continued to confiscate rainbow-coloured items from several fans.One fan attending a Group A final round game involving the Dutch national team on 29 November claimed to have had a security guard scream in his face, was forced to take off a multi-coloured baseball cap he was wearing and then was forced to strip his clothes, including his underwear. He then said his cap disappeared and security staff claimed he wasn't wearing it at all, only for it to emerge from behind a scanner. Then, when his ticket was being checked he was told to stand in the corner, where he was surrounded by seven people, four of whom were police and one of whom was wearing a FIFA uniform, where further threats were made.In a match between Portugal and Uruguay, in which Uruguay lost 2–0, a protestor invaded the pitch, waving a rainbow flag."
LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup_Homophobic football chants,"A perennial issue in the sport in some countries, homophobic football chants were reported to be heard at the first matches involving Mexico and Ecuador, particularly from Ecuador fans towards Chile and the Qatar team during the tournament's opening match, with FIFA opening hearings to determine disciplinary action. Mexico was subject of a second disciplinary measure by FIFA after the final group stage match against Saudi Arabia because of homophobic chants during the course of the game."
2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony_Summary,"The 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador.

The ceremony, which lasted for about 30 minutes, was dominated by Arab states of the Persian Gulf and Arab heritage."
2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony_Panels,"The ceremony included seven panels that merged the Qatari and international cultures, showing the country's culture and values, the importance of respecting the other, and the need to change the misconception about the Arab world.

The first panel, ""The Calling"", depicted the sound of ""El-Hoon"", which is associated with receiving guests. During the ""To Get to Know"" panel, Qatari personality Ghanim Al-Muftah engaged in a conversation with American artist Morgan Freeman, during which Al-Muftah recited verse 13 of Surat Al-Hujurat:يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ ذَكَرٍ وَأُنْثَى وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌO mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah [God] is the most righteous of you.
calling for acceptance of difference and diversity among human beings, within a framework of peace and love.The ""Rhythm of Nations"" panel combined Qatari music with the most famous cheers of encouragement for the 32 participating teams. This was followed by the ""Football Nostalgia"" panel, which collects former official mascots in honour of the previous host countries of the World Cup, followed by the ""Dreamers"" panel, which included performances by member of the Korean band BTS, Jungkook, who was later joined by Qatari artist Fahad Al Kubaisi.
An archival historical film was shown for the first time during the ""Roots of the Dream"" panel, showing the former Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, playing football with a group of his friends. The ceremony concluded with the panel ""Here and Now"", which consisted of a speech by the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and ended with the appearance of the official logo of the 2022 FIFA World Cup at a height of 15 meters coupled with a fireworks display."

2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Summary,"Group D of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022. The group consisted of reigning world champions France, Australia, Denmark and Tunisia. The top two teams, France and Australia advanced to the round of 16. Australia, Denmark and France were also in Group C of the previous World Cup."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Standings,"In the round of 16:

The winners of Group D, France, advanced to play the runners-up of Group C, Poland.
The runners-up of Group D, Australia, advanced to play the winners of Group C, Argentina."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Denmark vs Tunisia,"The two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2002, a 2–1 win for Denmark in a friendly game.
Denmark was not able to capitalize in their opening game; although Tunisia failed to score a single goal themselves, Aïssa Laïdouni earned the Man of the Match award for his defensive heroics."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_France vs Australia,"The two teams had faced each other five times, including once in the World Cup, in France's 2–1 victory in 2018 en route to the title. They also met in Australia's 1–0 win against the reigning world champions (having previously won the 1998 FIFA World Cup) at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup.
In the ninth minute Craig Goodwin gave Australia the lead when he finished at the back post high into the net after a low cross from the right by Mathew Leckie. Adrien Rabiot made it 1–1 when he headed to the net from a Théo Hernandez cross from the left. France took the lead five minutes later when Olivier Giroud side footed to the net after a low cross from Rabiot from the left.
In the 68th minute Kylian Mbappé scored with a header from six yards out to the left corner after a cross from Ousmane Dembélé on the right. Giroud got his second with another header after a Mbappé cross from the left to make it 4–1.
Giroud's second goal equalled Thierry Henry's all-time scoring record of 51 goals for France. France's win marked the first time since 2006 that the defending champion won their opening game. On the other hand, Craig Goodwin's goal was the fastest conceded goal for France since the 1982 FIFA World Cup.French defender Lucas Hernandez suffered a torn ACL after 13 minutes of the match."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Tunisia vs Australia,"The two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in Tunisia's 2–0 win at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.
Australia beat Tunisia 1–0 as a result of a Mitchell Duke header in the 23rd minute to secure their first win in a World Cup match since they defeated Serbia 2–1 in 2010. This was also Australia's first clean sheet since they drew 0–0 with Chile in 1974."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_France vs Denmark,"The teams had met thrice in the World Cup, all in the group stage with three different results; France won 2–1 in 1998, Denmark won 2–0 in 2002 and the teams drew 0–0 in 2018.
France won 2–1 and qualified for the knockout stage, thus becoming the first defending champions since Brazil in 2006 to advance from the group stage. Among European countries, they were the first World Cup holders to qualify for the knockout stage since Germany in 1994."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Australia vs Denmark,"The teams had met once in the World Cup, a 1–1 draw in 2018.
Australia won the game 1–0 to finish second in the group. The only goal of the match was scored by Mathew Leckie in the 60th minute with a low left-foot finish to the bottom right corner of the net. This result meant that Australia progressed to the knockout stage for the second time in their World Cup history, the first time since 2006 and the first time they did it as a member of the AFC. This was also the first time that Australia had won two consecutive matches, scored in every group stage game, and kept a clean sheet twice in a World Cup."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Tunisia vs France,"The two teams had faced each other four times, most recently in 2010 friendly, a 1–1 draw.
Wahbi Khazri put Tunisia into the lead in the 58th minute with a low shot to the bottom right corner. At that stage, Tunisia was in a position to qualify from the group. However, two minutes later Australia went in front against Denmark in the other match taking place at the same time, which put Tunisia outside of the qualifying positions. In added time, Antoine Griezmann scored to seemingly make it 1–1 with a volley but the goal was ruled out by VAR for offside. Australia went on to beat Denmark, which meant that Tunisia finished third in the group and failed to get into the knockout stage for the sixth consecutive World Cup.Viewers tuning in to French television for the match missed that the French team had lost the game 1–0. TF1 switched to an ad after Griezmann had seemingly levelled the game late in stoppage time, causing French viewers to miss the pitchside monitor consultation that led VAR to rule that Griezmann had been offside. French football supporters awoke in shock the following morning to belatedly discover that the game had not ended in a tie at all, but in a surprise defeat for the reigning world champions. The incident brought to mind the time British broadcaster ITV cut for an ad break and missed Steven Gerrard scoring England's opening goal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup."
2022 FIFA World Cup Group D_Discipline,"Fair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:

In the final minute Robert Lewandowski pulled a goal back to make it 3–1 with a penalty low to the left corner, awarded after a handball by Dayot Upamecano."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_England vs Senegal,"This was the first ever meeting between the sides. It was also the first time England faced an African opposition in the World Cup knockout stage since the 1990 quarter-final win over Cameroon.
England went front in the 38th minute when Jordan Henderson scored low to the net from 12 yards out after a pass from Jude Bellingham on the left. In the added time in the first half, reigning World Cup Golden Boot winner Harry Kane made it 2–0 with his first goal in the tournament, firing into the net from the right after a pass from Phil Foden. In the 57th minute Foden crossed from the left for Bukayo Saka to make it 3–0 with a clipped left-foot finish over Senegal goalkeeper Édouard Mendy."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Japan vs Croatia,"Japan had met Croatia three times, winning one, drawing one, and losing one. From the three, two happened in the World Cup group stages: Croatia won 1–0 in 1998 and drew 0–0 in 2006.

Japan missed three of their four penalties – all saved by goalkeeper Dominik Livaković – with Mario Pašalić scored the winning penalty with a low shot to the left as Croatia won 3–1 in the shoot-out. Livaković became the third goalkeeper to make three saves in a World Cup shoot-out, after Ricardo in 2006 and his fellow countryman Danijel Subašić in 2018."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Brazil vs South Korea,"Brazil had met South Korea seven times, winning six and losing one. They most recently met in June 2022, which Brazil won 5–1.Vinícius Júnior opened the scoring for Brazil in the 7th minute when he scored with a side footed shot to the right of the net past three Korean defenders on the line.

South Korea pulled a goal back in the second half when Paik Seung-ho finished to the right of the net from 30 yards out. With ten minutes left and leading by three goals, goalkeeper Alisson was substituted for third-choice Weverton, making Brazil the first team to ever use 26 different players in one World Cup and giving all 26 players play time in the tournament.The match was the last held at the Stadium 974 before its demolition."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Morocco vs Spain,"Morocco had met Spain in three full international matches, drawing one and losing two. Spain won both the 1962 World Cup inter-continental play-off legs, while the most recent meeting ended in a 2–2 draw in the 2018 World Cup group stage.After a goalless 120 minutes, the match went into penalty shoot-out, which Morocco won to reach the quarter-finals for the first time ever.

2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Portugal vs Switzerland,"Portugal had met Switzerland 25 times, winning 9, drawing 5, and losing 11. They met in several World Cup qualifications, in 1938, 1970, 1990, 1994, and 2018. Both teams most recently met in June 2022, with Switzerland winning 1–0 in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A.Cristiano Ronaldo was left out of the starting line-up for Portugal – a first in major tournaments since the UEFA Euro 2008 group stage defeat against Switzerland – with Gonçalo Ramos named instead to make his first start. This time, the Portuguese got their revenge as Ramos became the first hat-trick scorer of this World Cup, the first player to score hat-trick in his first World Cup start since Miroslav Klose in 2002, and the youngest World Cup hat-trick scorer since Flórián Albert in 1962 on course of beating the Swiss 6–1 to reach the quarter-finals, a first since 2006. In addition, he also assisted for Portugal's fourth goal scored by Raphaël Guerreiro. By scoring the second goal, Pepe became the oldest player to have scored at a World Cup knockout stage and the second-oldest to have scored at a World Cup, putting him only behind Roger Milla, who scored the consolation goal in Cameroon's thumping by the opposite scoreline in the 1994 group stage by Russia. Manuel Akanji scored the consolation goal before Portuguese substitute Rafael Leão replied."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Croatia vs Brazil,"Croatia had met Brazil four times, losing three and drawing one. Two of these took place in World Cup group stages with Brazil winning both times: 1–0 in 2006 and 3–1 in 2014.Neymar opened the scoring just before the half time of extra time when he received the ball back from Lucas Paquetá before rounding the goalkeeper and shooting high to the net from the right. A defensive lapse cost Brazil their lead as Bruno Petković equalised three minutes from the end with a left foot shot to the left corner deflection by the leg of a Brazilian; it was Croatia's only shot on target of the game. In the shoot-out, Croatia scored all four of their penalties, while Brazil's first kicker Rodrygo had his saved by Dominik Livaković diving to his left and Marquinhos hitting his penalty low against the left post sealing their elimination. Croatia qualified for their second successive World Cup semi-finals and the third time ever, while Brazil exited the tournament at the hands of European teams for the fifth consecutive time, all happened after their 2002 World Cup final triumph against Germany, which remains their last knockout stage win against European opposition. In the same period, Brazil was eliminated in all four quarter-finals they played away from home, thus excluding the fourth place finish at the 2014 tournament which they hosted."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Netherlands vs Argentina,"This was the 10th meeting between the Netherlands and Argentina, continuing a historic rivalry between the two nations. The Netherlands had won four of the previous nine meetings, Argentina had won one, and the remaining four matches were draws. They had met five previous times in World Cup matches: a 4–0 win for the Dutch at the second group stage in 1974 was replied with a 3–1 win for the Argentines in the 1978 final. The Dutch won 2–1 in the 1998 quarter-finals, prior to goalless draws in the 2006 group stage and the 2014 semi-finals, the Argentines wining the latter tie 4–2 on penalties.Nahuel Molina scored for Argentina after 35 minutes after he received a pass from Lionel Messi, flicking the ball low past the advancing goalkeeper. Messi made it 2–0 in the 73rd minute with a penalty, kicking to the right of the net after Marcos Acuña had been fouled in the penalty area. Netherlands substitute Wout Weghorst pulled a goal back in the 83rd minute with a downward header to the left after a cross from the right. He then got a second in the eleventh minute of added time when a free-kick on the edge of the box was played in low for him to get his shot in which went into the right of the net forcing the match to enter extra time, and ultimately ended in a penalty shoot-out. Just like in the 2014 encounter, two Dutch players missed from the spot, and four Argentines scored.The match had a total of 18 yellow cards, breaking the record of 16 that was set in another Dutch knockout defeat in the 2006 round of 16 against Portugal. The decisions by the referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz received criticism, as fans and media considered a yellow card to be too lenient for some incidents, while a potential handball by Messi was overlooked. The amount of yellow cards issued by Mateu Lahoz was also criticised.Because of this, the match was frequently referred to as the Battle of Lusail.The match was also marred by the death of American sportswriter Grant Wahl after he collapsed near the end of the match while watching in the press box."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Morocco vs Portugal,"Morocco had met Portugal twice, having won and lost once each. Both took place in World Cup group stages with Morocco winning 3–1 in 1986 and Portugal prevailing 1–0 in 2018.Youssef En-Nesyri put Morocco in the lead in the 42nd minute when he jumped high to head past the advancing goalkeeper and into the empty net, prompting Portugal to sub on Cristiano Ronaldo, thus equalling the record for most international caps set by Bader Al-Mutawa. However, Morocco clung on, becoming the first African and first Arab country to reach the World Cup semi-finals, as well as the second Muslim-majority country to qualify for the last four; the other was Turkey in 2002."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_England vs France,"England had met France 31 times, winning 17, drawing 5 and losing 9. Two of these took place during the World Cup with England winning both times: 2–0 in the 1966 group stage and 3–1 during the 1982 first group stage. They most recently met in a friendly in June 2017, with France winning 3–2.In the 17th minute Aurélien Tchouaméni opened the scoring with a shot from outside the penalty area to the left corner in the first half which beat England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford diving down to his right. Some pundits questioned the goal because England player Bukayo Saka had been brought to the ground allowing France to win possession in the build-up to the goal. Some thought it was a clear foul, while others, including British journalists, thought the contact was not clear enough for VAR to overturn the on-pitch decision. Early in the second half, Tchouaméni fouled Saka in the penalty box. Harry Kane scored the penalty against his club team-mate Hugo Lloris shooting to the left, bringing Kane level with Wayne Rooney as England's all-time top scorer at 53 goals. Olivier Giroud, who entered the match as France's all-time top scorer, also scored his 53rd international goal twelve minutes from time with a header to the left of the net after a cross from Antoine Griezmann on the left. In the 84th minute, England were awarded a second penalty when substitute Mason Mount was pushed over in the penalty area by Théo Hernandez. Kane again took a penalty but shot over the bar with France going on to win 2–1. France became the first reigning world champions to reach the World Cup semi-finals since Brazil in 1998, whom France would beat in that final. France's cruise to the semi-finals, along with Croatia's – whom they defeated in the 2018 final, marked the first time that both teams from a World Cup final reached the last four of the subsequent tournament since Argentina and West Germany in 1990."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Argentina vs Croatia,"Argentina and Croatia had met five times, each winning twice, and drawing once. Two of these matches took place in the World Cup group stages, a 1–0 win for Argentina in 1998 was followed by Croatia's 3–0 win in 2018.Both teams approached each other carefully in the first 30 minutes, until Dejan Lovren and Joško Gvardiol mistakenly let Julián Álvarez pass through the defense, causing Dominik Livaković to collide with Álvarez in the 34th minute. Match referee Daniele Orsato booked Livaković and awarded a penalty kick to Argentina, which Lionel Messi converted high to the right side of the goal. The collision also sparked a feud between Orsato and some Croatia players, causing Orsato to book Mateo Kovačić and send off assistant coach Mario Mandžukić. In the 39th minute, Álvarez passed through the defence and scored Argentina's second goal. In the second half of the match, Croatian coach Zlatko Dalić substituted off five players, including team captain Luka Modrić, in order to boost the attacking ability of the team, but this didn't stop Messi and Álvarez from providing another goal for the Argentinians. In the 69th minute, Messi dribbled through Gvardiol and passed the ball to Álvarez from the right, enabling Álvarez to score a second goal. The match ended with the scoreline of 3–0 to Argentina. Messi's penalty goal took him ahead of fellow countryman Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's most prolific goal-scorer at the World Cup, with 11 goals scored, and this match put him level with former German player Lothar Matthäus's record for the most matches played, with the final set to be his record-breaking 26th match."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_France vs Morocco,"France had met Morocco seven times, winning five and drawing two. They most recently met in a friendly in 2007, with the match ending in a 2–2 draw. This was their first World Cup meeting. This match marked the first ever World Cup semi-final featuring an African team, and also the first involving an Arab country. This was the third time that a team from a confederation other than Europe and South America has made it to the World Cup semi-finals, after the United States in 1930 and South Korea in 2002.
In the fifth minute Théo Hernandez scored with an acrobatic volley from a very tight angle on the left after Kylian Mbappé's shot was diverted into his path, giving France the early lead. Hernandez's goal, timed at four minutes and 39 seconds, was the fastest in a World Cup semi-final since Vavá netted in the second minute of Brazil's 5–2 win against France in 1958. Despite being in possession of the ball for most of the game, Morocco were not rewarded for this pressure and in the 79th minute, with his first touch of the game having come on as a substitute 44 seconds before, Randal Kolo Muani doubled the advantage with a close-range shot, after Mbappé had dribbled into the penalty area. France won 2–0 and set up a final against Argentina, also continuing to make progress toward becoming the first nation to successfully defend the World Cup in 60 years after Brazil's victories in 1958 and 1962."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Third place play-off,"The two teams had previously faced each other twice, including their opening game in Group F at this World Cup, which ended 0–0. This marked the second consecutive World Cup where the teams playing in the third place match also played each other in the group stage, following Belgium vs England in 2018.
The match started with an early goal, after Joško Gvardiol scored a diving header to the top left corner in the seventh minute following a headed pass from Ivan Perišić. Croatia's joy lasted only two minutes; in the ninth minute Achraf Dari received a deflection from a free kick and levelled the score with a close-range header, having been left unmarked in front of the net. However, the Vatreni managed to regain the lead in the 42nd minute through Mislav Oršić, who bent a brilliant strike from just inside the penalty area on the left, hitting the inside of the right post before the ball nestled in the back of the net. The second half held no goals, giving Croatia their second-ever third place finish, following the one achieved in 1998. This was the 11th consecutive World Cup in which European teams finished third, stretching back to 1982."
2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage_Argentina vs France,"The two sides had met twelve times, with Argentina having won six of them, France three, and the other three matches ending in draws. They had met three times in the World Cup, with two of these in group stages: Argentina winning 1–0 in 1930 (their World Cup debut) and 2–1 in 1978. Their most recent World Cup meeting resulted in France defeating Argentina 4–3 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup round of 16, France's first win over Argentina since 1986.Both teams were seeking to win their third World Cup title. France were the first title holders to play in the final since Brazil, whom they defeated in 1998, and were seeking to become the first nation to retain the World Cup in 60 years, after Brazil's victories in 1958 and 1962. Their coach Didier Deschamps was attempting to become the first manager to win multiple World Cup titles since Vittorio Pozzo in 1934 and 1938 with Italy. Argentina were seeking to win the title for the first time in 36 years, having won in 1978 and 1986.
Leading 2–0 at half time from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María, Argentina conceded two goals in two minutes from Kylian Mbappé. In the extra time, Messi scored again only for Mbappé to equalise from a penalty, making him the first player since Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final. Having scored one in 2018, he became the first player to score four goals in multiple World Cup finals as well as the first player to score eight goals in one World Cup since Ronaldo in 2002 en route to the title; however, Mbappé failed to emulate Hurst's and Ronaldo's successes: despite him scoring the first penalty for France, they lost 4–2 in the penalty shoot-out. Argentina achieved their third world title, surpassing France and Uruguay. They also became the first non-European side to win the title since Brazil in 2002, when the World Cup was also held in Asia. France's loss was their second in a World Cup final, having been defeated by Italy in 2006 in a match which was also decided by penalties. Some reporters regarded the match as one of the best FIFA World Cup finals of all time."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Summary,"The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups was the process by which the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selected locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups. The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included England, Russia, a joint bid from Belgium and Netherlands, and a joint bid from Portugal and Spain. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. Indonesia's bid was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.
On 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively. The selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the FIFA Executive Committee had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or prosecuted for corruption."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Background,"In October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead, countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving Africa ineligible for 2018 and South America ineligible for both 2018 and 2022. Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations. Voting is done using a multiple round exhaustive ballot system whereby the candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round is eliminated until a single candidate is chosen by the majority."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Rotation policy,"Following the selection of the 2006 World Cup hosts, FIFA had decided on a policy for determining the hosts of future editions. The six world confederations — roughly corresponding to continents – would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the 2010 (South Africa) and 2014 World Cup (Brazil) hosts, open only to CAF and CONMEBOL members, respectively.
In September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations. This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in Zurich, Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid could have come from CONCACAF, AFC, UEFA, or OFC, as Africa and South America were ineligible. Likewise, no CONMEBOL member could make a 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.
The United States, the last non-European candidate in the 2018 bidding cycle, withdrew its bid for that year; hence the 2018 tournament would have to be held in Europe. This in turn meant that CONMEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Voting procedure,"For both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the FIFA Executive Committee voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority. In the event of a tied vote, FIFA President Sepp Blatter would have had the deciding vote. There are twenty-four members on the committee, but two of those were suspended due to accusations of selling votes."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_2018 bids,"Eleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering thirteen nations, with two joint bids: Belgium-Netherlands and Portugal-Spain. Mexico also submitted a bid, but withdrew theirs on 28 September 2009, while Indonesia had their bid rejected for lack of government support on 19 March 2010. Five of the remaining nine bids, South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and United States were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others bid for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. However, since all of the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA's rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted either of the two preceding tournaments are not eligible to host, all UEFA bids were forced to be for 2018 only. Four bids came from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), four from Europe's UEFA, and one from CONCACAF. It had also been reported on the FIFA website that Egypt was entering a bid, but the president of the Egyptian Football Association denied that any more than an inquiry in principle had been made."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Belgium and the Netherlands,"Alain Courtois, a Belgian Member of Parliament, announced in October 2006 that a formal bid would be made on behalf of the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
In June 2007 the three countries launched their campaign not as a joint bid in the manner of the Korea-Japan World Cup in 2002, but emphasising it as a common political organisation. Luxembourg would not host any matches or automatically qualify for the finals in a successful Benelux bid, but would host a FIFA congress.Belgium and the Netherlands registered their intention to bid jointly in March 2009. A delegation led by the presidents of the Belgian and Dutch national football associations met FIFA president Sepp Blatter on 14 November 2007, officially announcing their interest in submitting a joint bid. On 19 March 2008 the delegation also met with UEFA President Michel Platini to convince him that it was a serious offer under one management. Afterwards they claimed to have impressed Platini, who supports the idea of getting the World Cup to Europe. Former French football international Christian Karembeu was presented as official counselor for the joint bid on 23 June 2009.
A factor that was against the Benelux bid was the lack of an 80,000 capacity stadium to host the final.
However, the city council of Rotterdam gave permission in March 2009 for development of a new stadium with a capacity of around 80,000 seats to be completed in time for the possible World Cup in 2018.
In November 2009, the venues were presented. In Belgium, matches would have been played in 7 venues: Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Charleroi, Genk, Ghent and Liège. In the Netherlands, only five cities would host matches: Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Enschede, Heerenveen and Rotterdam, but both Amsterdam and Rotterdam would provide two stadiums. Eindhoven would function as the 'capital city' of the World Cup. Euro 2000 was also jointly hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_England,"On 31 October 2007, The Football Association officially announced its bid to host the event. On 24 April 2008 England finalised a 63-page bid to host the 2018 World Cup, focusing on the development of football worldwide. On 27 January 2009, England officially submitted their bid to FIFA.Richard Caborn led England's bid to stage the event after stepping down as Sports Minister. On 24 October 2008 the Football Association named the Executive Board to prepare the bid, with David Triesman as the bid chairman. Triesman resigned on 16 May 2010 after comments were published where he suggested that Spain would drop their bid if Russia helped bribe referees in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and was then replaced by Geoff Thompson.The British government backed the England 2018 bid. In November 2005, Chancellor Gordon Brown and Sport Minister Tessa Jowell first announced that they were to investigate the possibility of bidding.
That month, Adrian Bevington, the Football Association's Director of Communications, announced the support of the Government and the Treasury in the bid, but put off definite proposals.
Brown reiterated his support for a bid in March 2006, before England's 2006 World Cup campaign, and again in May 2006.
The UK government launched its official report on 12 February 2007, in which it was made clear that its support was for an England-only bid and that all games would be played at English grounds. The venues selected on 16 December 2009 to form the bid were: London (three stadiums), Manchester (two stadiums), Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Nottingham, Plymouth, Sheffield and Sunderland.FIFA officials also expressed interest in an English bid. David Will, a vice-president of FIFA, noted England's World Cup proposal as early as May 2004.Franz Beckenbauer, leader of Germany's successful bid for the 2006 World Cup and a member of FIFA's Executive Committee, twice publicly backed an English bid to host the World Cup, in January and July 2007.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter said he would welcome a 2018 bid from ""the homeland of football.""
Blatter met David Cameron on two occasions to discuss the bid while paying visits to England. The British Prime Minister showed much support for the bid and was hopeful that the ""home of football"" would host the tournament.In an interview the leader of Russia's bid, Alexei Sorokin, criticised England's bid citing London's high crime rate, alcohol consumption among young people and English fans ""inciting ethnic hatred."" England filed a complaint, though the complaint was withdrawn following Russia's apology."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Portugal and Spain,"The President of the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF), Gilberto Madail, first proposed a joint bid with Spain in November 2007. The bid intent was confirmed by FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, on 18 February 2008.
However, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Angel Villar, announced in July 2008 that it was Spain's intention to submit an individual World Cup bid, and that positive contacts had already taken place with the government, through the secretary of sports, Jaime Lissavetzky. No specifications were made then regarding a joint bid with Portugal. On 23 November 2008, after his re-election for the RFEF presidency, Villar pledged that one of the fundamental objectives of his term was to bring a World Cup to Spain. While he did not mention whether Spain would present a joint bid with Portugal, he did not rule it out when asked about it.On 23 December 2008, Angel Villar restated ""We need to present a strong, consistent and winning bid for the 2018 World Cup."" He further confessed ""Personally, I think it should be with Portugal."" Subsequently, in the aftermath of a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper Marca advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively. Spain has previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, while Portugal organised the Euro 2004."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Russia,"Russia announced its intent to bid in early 2009, and submitted its request to FIFA in time. The bid committee also included RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations.Fourteen cities were included in the proposal, which divided them into five different clusters: one in the north, centered on Saint Petersburg, a central cluster, centered on Moscow, a southern cluster, centered on Sochi, and the Volga River cluster. Only one city beyond the Ural Mountains was cited, Yekaterinburg. The other cities were: Kaliningrad in the north cluster, Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar in the south cluster and Yaroslavl, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Saransk, Samara and Volgograd in the Volga River cluster. At the time of bidding, Russia did not have a stadium with 80,000 capacity, but the bid called for the expansion of Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, already a UEFA Elite stadium, from a capacity of slightly over 78,000 to over 89,000. Russia hoped to have five stadiums fit to host World Cup matches ready by 2013 – two in Moscow and one stadium each in Saint Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi, which at the time was due to host the 2014 Winter Olympics."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Australia,"In September 2007, the Football Federation Australia confirmed that Australia would bid for the 2018 World Cup finals.
Previously, in late May 2006, the Victorian sports minister, Justin Madden, said that he wanted his state to drive a bid to stage the 2018 World Cup. Frank Lowy, the FFA chairman, stated that they aimed to use 16 stadiums for the bid.
Then Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the Federal Government's support for the bid,
and in December 2008, Federal minister for sport Kate Ellis announced that the federal government would give the FFA $45.6 million to fund its World Cup bid preparation.
Rudd met with Sepp Blatter to discuss the Commonwealth Government's support of the bid in Zurich in July 2009.At the 2008 FIFA Congress, held in Sydney, FIFA president Sepp Blatter suggested that Australia concentrate on hosting the 2022 tournament, but Lowy responded by recommitting Australia to its 2018 bid. However, Australia ultimately withdrew from the bidding for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in favour of the 2022 FIFA World Cup on 10 June 2010, following comments from the chief of the Asian Football Confederation that the 2018 tournament should be held in Europe.Australia's largest stadiums are currently used by other major Australian sports whose domestic seasons overlap with the World Cup. The Australian Football League and National Rugby League claimed that loss of access to these major venues for eight weeks would severely disrupt their seasons and impact the viability of their clubs. The AFL in particular had previously advised it would not relinquish Etihad Stadium in Melbourne for the entire period required. On 9 May 2010 the AFL, NRL, and FFA announced a Memorandum of Understanding guaranteeing that the AFL and NRL seasons would continue, should the bid be successful. Compensation for the rival football codes would be awarded as a result of any disruptions caused by hosting the World Cup. AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou came out in support of the bid, despite initially not supporting the bid. Franz Beckenbauer indicated that the issue of factional disputes between the FFA, NRL and, AFL were not considered by the FIFA Executive Committee. Although initially Australia seemed to be a popular contender to host the tournament, the final Australian World Cup bid received only one vote astonishing Franz Beckenbauer and experts alike."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Japan,"Japan bid to become the first Asian country to host the World Cup twice; however, the fact that they were co-hosts so recently in 2002 was expected to work against them in their bid. Although Japan did not have an 80,000-seat capacity stadium, its plan was based on a proposed 100,000-seat stadium that would have gone on to be a centrepiece of 2016 Olympics, for which Tokyo was bidding.
Japan also pledged that if it had been granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop technology enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in 3D, which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time. Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being in the presence of the players. Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.
The Olympic bid was unsuccessful, coming third in the bidding process that concluded in October 2009. The Vice-President of the Japan Football Association, Junji Ogura, had previously admitted that if Tokyo were to fail in its bid, its chances of hosting either the 2018 or 2022 World Cup would not be very good. On 4 May 2010, Japan announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the 2018 tournament to focus on 2022, amidst rising speculation that the 2018 edition will be held in Europe."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Qatar,"Qatar made a bid for only the 2022 World Cup. Qatar was attempting to become the first Arab country to host the World Cup. Failed bids from other Arab countries include Morocco (1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010), Egypt and a Libya-Tunisia joint bid withdrew in the 2010 World Cup bidding process.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, son of the former Emir of Qatar, was the chairman of the bid committee.
Qatar planned to promote the bid as an Arab unity bid and hoped to draw on support from the entire Arab world and were positioning this as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab and Western worlds. The bid launched an advertising campaign across the nation in November 2009.Some concerns with Qatar's bid deal with the extreme temperatures. The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40 °C (104 °F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30 °C (86 °F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying ""the event has to be organised in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well."" The first five proposed stadiums are planned to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.President of FIFA Sepp Blatter endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Middle East, saying in April 2010, ""The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organise the tournament."" Blatter also praised Qatar's progress, ""When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the Asian Games (in 2006) with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question."" Qatar's bid to host the 2022 World Cup received a huge boost on 28 July 2010 when Asian Football Confederation (AFC) President Mohammed Bin Hammam threw his weight behind his country's campaign. Speaking in Singapore, Bin Hammam said: ""I have one vote and, frankly speaking, I will vote for Qatar but if Qatar is not in the running I will vote for another Asian country."" Qatar has already hosted the AFC Asian Cup in 1988, FIFA U-20 World Cup 1995 and the 2011 AFC Asian Cup."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_South Korea,"South Korea bid only for the 2022 World Cup. They were bidding to become the first Asian country to host the World Cup twice; however, the fact that they were co-hosts so recently in 2002 was expected to work against them in their bid. Han Seung-joo, a former South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as the Chairman of the Bidding Committee in August 2009. He met with FIFA President Sepp Blatter in Zürich, Switzerland. In January 2010, President Lee Myung-bak visited the headquarters of FIFA in Zurich, Switzerland to meet Sepp Blatter in support of the South Korean bid.
Although South Korea did not have an 80,000 capacity stadium, it planned to upgrade an existing venue to meet that capacity. There are three grounds which can seat over 60,000 people—Seoul Olympic Stadium, Seoul World Cup Stadium and Daegu Stadium.  Another 70,000 seat stadium is scheduled to be built in Incheon as the main stadium for the 2014 Asian Games. Other venues meet hosting requirements as they were built for the 2002 World Cup. The 12 cities selected to hold the finals were South Korea to win the bid were selected in March 2010 and were Busan, Cheonan, Daegu, Daejeon, Goyang, Gwangju, Incheon (2 venues), Jeonju, Seogwipo, Seoul (2 venues), Suwon and Ulsan."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_United States,"U.S. Soccer first said in February 2007 that it would bid for the 2018 World Cup. On 28 January 2009, U.S. Soccer then announced that it would submit bids for both the 2018 and 2022 Cups. David Downs, president of Univision Sports, was executive director of the bid. Other committee members included president of U.S. Soccer Sunil Gulati, U.S. Soccer chief executive officer Dan Flynn, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber, and Phil Murphy, the former national finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee. The vice president of FIFA, Jack Warner, who is also the president of CONCACAF, originally said he would try to bring the World Cup back to the CONCACAF region.
However, Warner also stated that he preferred the USSF change their plans to make a bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.In April 2009, the bid committee identified 70 stadiums in 50 communities as possible venues for the tournament, with 58 confirming their interest. The list of stadiums was trimmed two months later to 45 in 37 cities, and then in August 2009 to 32 stadiums in 27 cities. In January 2010, 18 cities and 21 stadiums were selected for the final bid. The cities were Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston (Foxboro), Dallas, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. The cities with multiple qualifying stadiums were Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas and Washington. With several large American football stadiums, the 21 venues were to have an average capacity of 77,000; none seated fewer than 65,000. Seven of the stadiums seat at least 80,000. Two proposed stadiums would be used by Major League Soccer during the summer.In October 2010, the United States withdrew from the 2018 bid process, to focus solely on the 2022 competition."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Cancelled bids,"Two countries had to cancel bids for the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cups before individual evaluations began. Mexico cancelled its bid for both cups, while Indonesia was only bidding for the 2022 World Cup."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Indonesia,"In January 2009 the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) confirmed their intention to bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with government support. In February 2009, PSSI launched the ""Green World Cup Indonesia 2022"" campaign.
This campaign included a $1 billion plan to upgrade supporting infrastructure beside stadiums to meet FIFA's requirements. The funds to construct stadiums were to come from regional governments. Indonesia had previously made World Cup history when it became the first Asian nation to play in a World Cup, at the 1938 tournament in France under its colonial name of the Dutch East Indies. Indonesia also had tournament hosting experience as the co-host of 2007 AFC Asian Cup.
In the campaign presentation, PSSI president Nurdin Halid said he believed Indonesia stood a chance to win FIFA's approval to host the 2022 World Cup, despite the relatively poor infrastructure, coupled with the low quality of the national squad compared to other candidates. He said Indonesia had proposed a ""Green World Cup 2022"", hoping to capitalise on the current green and global warming movement worldwide: ""Our deforestation rate has contributed much to world pollution. By hosting the World Cup, we wish to build infrastructure and facilities that are environmentally friendly so we can give more to the planet.""The bid was launched at a moment when there were strong pressures from Indonesian football fans for Halid to step down from his position as chairman of PSSI. There was no official support from the government of Indonesia until 9 February 2010, the deadline for the country's government to file a letter of support for the bid. Secretary General of PSSI Nugraha Besoes did not deny that Indonesia could be disqualified from the bidding process because the Indonesian government did not support the bid. On 19 March 2010, FIFA rejected Indonesia's bid to host the 2022 World Cup because the government stated that their concern is for the people of the country and so could not support the bid as FIFA requested. As a consequence, PSSI threw their support behind Australia's bid for the 2022 tournament."

2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Voting rounds,"On 2 December 2010, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced the winning bids at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich. Russia was chosen to host the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar was chosen to host the 2022 World Cup. This made Russia the first Eastern European country to host the World Cup, while Qatar would be the first Middle Eastern country to host the World Cup.
Blatter noted that the committee had decided to ""go to new lands"" and reflected a desire to ""develop football"" by bringing it to more countries.In each round a majority of twelve votes was needed. If no bid received 12 votes in a round, the bid with the fewest votes in that round was eliminated, and accordingly each remaining bid should receive no fewer votes in subsequent rounds than in preceding rounds. Multiple bids received fewer votes in voting round 2 compared to voting round 1 (Netherlands/Belgium, Qatar and Japan), at least 2 voting members in each of the 2018 and 2022 votes changed their votes between voting rounds despite their initial bid not being eliminated in voting round 1. The actual votes cast were as follows:"
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Allegations of vote-buying,"Shortly after the voting in December 2010, ESPN published allegations linking Qatar's successful bid to Football Dreams, a youth development program that channeled money from the Qatari government to football programs in 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia—six of which had representatives on the FIFA executive committee. In February 2011, Blatter admitted that the Spanish and Qatari bid teams did try to trade votes, ""but it didn't work"".In May 2011, the former England 2018 bid chief Lord Treisman told a House of Commons select committee that four FIFA committee members approached him asking for various things in exchange for votes. Among the accused were FIFA Vice President Jack Warner, who allegedly asked for £2.5 million to be used for projects, and Nicolás Leoz, who allegedly asked to be knighted. The Sunday Times further reported that month that Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were given $1.5 million in exchange for their votes in favor of Qatar. On 30 May 2011, FIFA President Sepp Blatter rejected the evidence in a press conference, while Jack Warner, who had been suspended that day for a separate ethics violations pending an investigation, leaked an email from FIFA General Secretary Jérôme Valcke which suggested that Qatar had ""bought"" the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had ""used its financial muscle to lobby for support"". Qatar officials denied any impropriety. Theo Zwanziger, President of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the Cup to Qatar.In July 2012, FIFA appointed former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Garcia to investigate allegations of vote-buying in the selection process. He submitted the report in September 2014, which FIFA at the time declined to release in full. Instead, FIFA released a summary that Garcia described as ""materially incomplete,"" leading Garcia to resign in protest. FIFA ultimately published the report in 2017, after German tabloid Bild announced they would publish a leaked copy. The report detailed dozens of allegations but didn't provide hard evidence for vote-buying. In May 2015, as members gathered in Zürich for the 65th FIFA Congress, U.S. federal prosecutors disclosed cases of corruption leading to the arrest of seven. More than 40 individuals were indicted, including 2018 and 2022 voters Luis Bedoya, Chuck Blazer, Nicolás Leoz, Rafael Salguero, Ricardo Teixeira, and Jack Warner. The resulting cases led FIFA to suspend many members, including Issa Hayatou, and the end of Sepp Blatter's presidency of the organization.In April 2020, the United States Department of Justice unsealed further indictments against voters Nicolás Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira, Julio Grondona of Argentina, and Jack Warner. The indictments spelled out how shell corporations and sham consulting contracts were used to pay voters between $1–5 million for their support. Other voters who had previously pleaded guilty to accepting bribes, including Rafael Salguero of Guatemala, aided in the indictments, which when included with previous cases, mean that more than half of the voters were accused of wrongdoing related to their votes. Voter Franz Beckenbauer has also been accused by Swiss prosecutors of embezzlement and money laundering related to voting in the 2006 FIFA World Cup host selection, while Ángel María Villar was arrested in July 2017 for embezzlement, after previously being fined for failure to cooperate with investigations into vote-buying in the 2018 and 2022 host selection."
2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids_Reactions,"In reaction to the announcement there were celebrations on the streets of Russia and Qatar. The Qatar Stock Exchange responded strongly with increased participation in trading following the announcement.Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told his Qatari counterpart that hosting the tournament ""is a big athletic event which can promote football in the Persian Gulf area and Middle East region."" He also said Iran was ready to help Qatar in hosting the event, while saying he hoped its neighbours ""could achieve a reasonable share to attend the games."" al-Thani ""underlined [a] necessity of cooperation between regional countries to use and take advantage of the sport opportunity."" He also added that Qatar's initiative would motivate its neighbours to ""promote and develop their football.""Roger Burden, who had been acting chairman of England's Football Association, withdrew his application for the permanent post days after the vote, saying he could not trust FIFA members due to their actions. England's bid executive Andy Anson said ""I think it has to [change] because otherwise why would Australia, the United States, Holland, Belgium, England ever bother bidding again?""There was also a backlash from the media in the losing countries; the majority of British newspapers alleged that the World Cup had been ""sold"" to Russia, and the Spanish El Mundo, Dutch Algemeen Dagblad, and the Japanese Nikkei made comments about the financial power of Russia and Qatar's commodity and energy reserves. American newspapers the Seattle Times and Wall Street Journal alleged collusion and corruption."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_Summary,"The 2022 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 22nd edition of FIFA's competition for men's national football teams. The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. The tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, with two wins and one loss, before defeating Australia in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out and Croatia in the semi-final. France finished top of Group D with two wins and one loss, defeating Poland in the round of 16, England in the quarter-final and Morocco in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 88,966 spectators, with more than 1.5 billion people watching on television, and was refereed by Szymon Marciniak.
Argentina took the lead through a penalty by Lionel Messi in the 23rd minute before Ángel Di María further increased their lead in the 36th minute with a low shot into the corner of the goal after a sweeping Argentina counterattack. France failed to register a shot on goal for the vast majority of the match until a 97-second brace by Kylian Mbappé tied the game 2–2 in the 81st minute. During extra time, Messi then scored again to give Argentina a 3–2 lead. However, Mbappé scored another penalty to tie the game 3–3 with only minutes remaining, becoming the second man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final, after Geoff Hurst in 1966. Argentina then won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4–2 to win their third World Cup, and first since 1986.
Argentina became the second team after Spain in 2010 to win the World Cup after losing their opening game. France became the first team to score three goals in a World Cup final and lose. Messi was named the man of the match, and won the Golden Ball as FIFA's best player of the tournament. The match was widely praised and regarded as one of the greatest World Cup finals of all time, and one of the greatest matches in the history of the sport."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_Background,"Argentina had won the World Cup twice before, in 1978 and 1986. They had also finished as losing finalists thrice, in 1930, 1990 and 2014. After the 2014 final loss, they went on to lose two consecutive Copa América finals to Chile, in 2015 and 2016. After a string of disappointing performances in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to eventual champions France in the first knockout round, and the 2019 Copa América, where they finished third, newly-appointed coach Lionel Scaloni led Argentina to their first international title since the 1993 Copa América: Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 in the 2021 Copa América Final, handing captain Lionel Messi his first international title with Argentina. After winning the 2022 Finalissima, beating European champions Italy 3–0, Argentina entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.France were the defending champions from the 2018 World Cup, which made this the first time since the 2002 final in which a team had consecutive appearances at the finals, and the first since 1998 in which the title holders qualified for the subsequent final – both feats achieved by Brazil. France had claimed two World Cups, in 1998 and 2018. The French also reached the 2006 final, but fell to Italy on penalties. Under the management of Didier Deschamps, who won the 1998 tournament as a player, the French failed to conquer the 2014 World Cup and UEFA Euros 2016 and 2020, but successfully clinched the 2018 World Cup title. Due to their status as the world champions, France also entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win. France aimed to emulate the achievement of Italy in 1934 and 1938 and Brazil in 1958 and 1962 as the third country to successfully defend the World Cup title. Deschamps was seeking to become the second manager to win two mens' FIFA World Cup titles, after Vittorio Pozzo with Italy in 1934 and 1938. Having won the 1998 tournament as a player, Deschamps was also seeking to become the third person to win three FIFA World Cup titles, after Brazilian legends Pelé (all as a player) and Mário Zagallo (two as a player, one as a manager).The two nations met in the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup. In 2018 in Russia at the Kazan Arena in the round of 16, France won the encounter 4–3 in what The Independent called ""one of the greatest World Cup games of all time"". Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring with a penalty before Ángel Di María and Gabriel Mercado put Argentina in front, with France then scoring the next three goals courtesy of Benjamin Pavard's volley outside of the box – which was later voted as the goal of the tournament – and then Kylian Mbappé twice. Sergio Agüero reduced the deficit to one in stoppage time, but Argentina was unable to equalise and send the match to extra time.The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, third place match and final was announced on 11 December 2022. It was a variation of the Adidas Al Rihla used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas Al-Hilm, meaning ""The Dream"" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup. Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy. It is the fifth special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin, Jo'bulani, Brazuca Final Rio, and Telstar Mechta."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_Venue,"The final was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, located about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of the city centre of Doha. The stadium was intended to host the final as part of Qatar's World Cup bid, and was confirmed as the final venue on 15 July 2020. The stadium was allocated to also host nine previous World Cup matches, with six in the group stage and three other knockout fixtures.Lusail Stadium, owned by the Qatar Football Association, was built as part of Qatar's winning bid for the World Cup. The stadium was designed by British firm Foster and Partners and Populous, supported by MANICA Architecture. The stadium uses solar power to be cooled and is claimed to have a carbon zero footprint. Construction began in April 2017, and was planned to finish in 2020. Completion of the stadium was postponed, with construction ultimately finished in November 2021. The stadium hosted its first match, the Lusail Super Cup, on 9 September 2022, later than expected."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_Argentina,"Drawn in group C and coming off a three-year, 36-game-long unbeaten streak, Argentina were defeated in their opening game 2–1 by Saudi Arabia. Lionel Messi's opener from the penalty spot was followed by several disallowed Argentina goals which were ruled offside. Immediately after half-time, Saudi Arabia stunned Argentina with two goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari in a span of five minutes before shutting out any further attempts by the South Americans in a disciplined defensive performance. However, the Argentines bounced back from the shock loss to overcome Mexico 2–0 after a long-range effort by Messi who then assisted Enzo Fernández for the second, reigniting their World Cup hopes. Boosted by the win, Argentina then beat Poland with the same scoreline with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez despite a first-half penalty miss from Messi, taking first place in Group C and condemning both Mexico and Saudi Arabia to World Cup elimination.In the round of 16, the Argentines found themselves matched against group D runners-up Australia; Messi's first-ever knockout-stage goal was followed by an astute goal by Álvarez, who intercepted Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to finish into an empty net as Argentina overcame Australia 2–1, despite an own goal from Fernández creating a frantic finish which required a late save from point-blank range by Emiliano Martínez. Continuing a rivalry, they proceed to square off against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. In a controversial match noted for its dramatic nature, chaotic atmosphere, and fury between both teams,  it saw Argentina lead by two goals coming from Nahuel Molina and a penalty from Messi, but succumbed to two late goals by Wout Weghorst as regulation time ended 2–2 after 90 minutes; neither could find the breakthrough in extra time and penalties were used to decide the winner. Emiliano Martínez saved the first two Dutch penalties from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis, while only Fernández missed for Argentina as Lautaro Martínez scored the decisive last kick of the game, a result reminiscent of their 2014 most recent, also knockout stage meeting and sending them through the semi-finals, as they meet 2018 runners up Croatia.  In a rematch of the 2018 encounter when Croatia had won 3–0, Argentina decisively beat Croatia by the same scoreline. Lionel Messi scored a first-half penalty before Álvarez scored a solo effort five minutes later. Messi then assisted Álvarez for his double in the second half, as Argentina booked their place in the final for the second time in eight years."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_France,"France started their World Cup campaign as the defending world champions, having won the most recent tournament in Russia, and was drawn in group D. Their first meeting was against AFC representative Australia. The French suffered a shock deficit after nine minutes due to a goal by Craig Goodwin, but were able to stage a comeback with a double from Olivier Giroud together with goals from Adrien Rabiot and Kylian Mbappé to win 4–1. Empowered by the win, France overcame a highly organised and threatening Denmark side with Mbappé striking twice in the second half, despite conceding an equaliser from Andreas Christensen. France won 2–1 and became the first team to progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup in Qatar and the first European world champions to do so since 1994. With progression assured, France rotated most of their team, resting their key players for the final game against a desperate Tunisia; France resultantly lost 1–0 courtesy of a goal by French-born Wahbi Khazri before having an equaliser by Antoine Griezmann disallowed. France maintained top of the group due to a superior goal difference over Australia.In the round of 16, France overcame group C runners-up Poland 3–1 with goals from Giroud and Mbappé, despite conceding a late penalty from Robert Lewandowski. The quarter-finals saw France battling old rivals England in a tense match, with France defeating England 2–1 with goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Giroud; England found an equaliser for 1–1 courtesy of a penalty by Harry Kane but a second penalty to equalise the game was missed by Kane, granting France a place in the semi-finals. France then faced the biggest underdog of the tournament, Morocco, who had beaten both Iberian representatives Spain and Portugal in the process; the French were able to end the history-making run by the African nation with two goals from Théo Hernandez and Randal Kolo Muani. France reached their second consecutive World Cup final for the first time in their history."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_Pre-match,"Polish referee Szymon Marciniak was named as the referee of the final on 15 December 2022, with fellow Poles Paweł Sokolnicki and Tomasz Listkiewicz appointed as assistant referees. Marciniak became a FIFA referee in 2011 and had previously served as a referee at the UEFA Euro 2016 and 2018 FIFA World Cup, as well as during the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. Earlier in the tournament, Marciniak officiated the France–Denmark group stage game, as well as the Argentina–Australia match in the round of 16. It was the first time that a Polish referee led the team of officials at a World Cup final, and the second time that a Polish referee was included among the officials during such a match, after Michał Listkiewicz (father of Marciniak's assistant Tomasz) served as a linesman during the 1990 FIFA World Cup final.

Ismail Elfath and Kathryn Nesbitt of the United States were appointed as fourth official and reserve assistant referee, respectively, while another Pole, Tomasz Kwiatkowski, led the video assistant referee team. Venezuelan Juan Soto served as assistant video assistant referee, American Kyle Atkins was the offside video assistant referee, and the role of support video assistant referee was assigned to Mexican Fernando Guerrero. German Bastian Dankert and American Corey Parker served as stand-by video assistant referee and stand-by assistant video assistant referee, respectively.Several heads of state were in attendance, among them Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and French president Emmanuel Macron. Various members of the FIFA Council and FIFA president Gianni Infantino were also in attendance. Argentine head of state Alberto Fernández did not attend after having reportedly refused to travel to Qatar due to potential political backlash. However, Chiqui Tapia, the President of the Argentine Football Association was present in the final. 
The tournament's closing ceremony was held prior to the start of the match; it featured a collaboration between Puerto Rican singer Ozuna and French rapper Gims. Also performing were Nora Fatehi, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Manal.The winners trophy was unveiled by World Cup winning captain Iker Casillas and Indian actress Deepika Padukone.Argentine singer Lali Espósito sang the ""Argentine National Anthem"" and Egyptian mezzo-soprano Farrah Eldibany sang the French national anthem, ""La Marseillaise"", before the match."
2022 FIFA World Cup final_Post-match,"Pundits, commentators, and audiences praised the intensity, stressful atmosphere, and thrilling back-and-forth nature of the match, highlighting the number of goals scored, and with many media outlets spotlighting it as a duel between Paris Saint-Germain teammates Messi and Mbappé. The match has since been hailed as one of the most exciting World Cup finals, and among the greatest football matches of all time.With the victory, Argentina won their third FIFA World Cup title to surpass France and Uruguay, their titles ranking behind only Brazil's five and the four of Italy and Germany. They became the first South American and first non-European side to win the World Cup since Brazil in 2002, and the first reigning champions of the Copa América to win the World Cup. Having won on penalties against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, Argentina became the first team to have won on that method twice en route to the title. It was the tenth World Cup title for a South American side, and the eighth South American victory in eleven finals facing European opposition. France became the third defending champions to lose in the following final, after Argentina in 1990 and Brazil in 1998. The match was the third FIFA World Cup final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out, after 1994 and 2006, the latter of which France also lost to Italy. This meant that France have never won on penalties in all competitions since the 1998 World Cup quarter-final against Italy. The six goals in the final brought the total number of goals in the tournament to a record 172, surpassing the 171 goals scored in 1998 and 2014.FIFA president Gianni Infantino was present on the pitch stage during the awards ceremony to hand out the medals and present the trophy to the Argentine captain Lionel Messi. He was joined by Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, French president Emmanuel Macron, Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia, French Football Federation president Noël Le Graët, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez and UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin. Sergio Batista and Nery Pumpido, World Cup winners with Argentina in 1986, brought the trophy onto the pitch for the ceremony. Before being presented with the trophy by the Emir and Infantino, Messi was given a bisht to wear by the Emir prior to the trophy celebration. The trophy presentation had scenery unlike previous tournaments, with confetti replaced by pyrotechnics and lights.Messi was named as the player of the match and won his second Golden Ball award after 2014 as the best player of the tournament, becoming the first (and so far only) player to receive the award twice. He also won the Silver Boot award with the second-most goals at the tournament, seven. Messi's appearance in the final, his 26th World Cup game, meant he surpassed Lothar Matthäus as the player with the most appearances in the World Cup. With his goals, Messi became the second player to score in the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a World Cup tournament, after Hungary's György Sárosi in 1938, and the only player to score in all of those knockout rounds as well as the group stage. Having scored once in the previous final, Mbappé's hat-trick made him the highest-scoring player in the final of the World Cup with four goals, surpassing the three of Hurst, Pelé, Vavá and Zinedine Zidane. In addition, with his three goals, he surpassed Messi to win the Golden Boot award as the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals, the most in a World Cup since Brazil's Ronaldo in 2002, and also was awarded the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the World Cup. Argentina's Emiliano Martínez won the Golden Glove award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, while his teammate Enzo Fernández won the Young Player Award as the best player at the World Cup who is at most 21 (born on or after 1 January 2001).In Argentina, celebrations erupted across the country, most notably in the capital Buenos Aires and in Rosario, Messi's hometown. On 20 December, the celebration in the streets of Buenos Aires after the arrival of the players of Argentina gathered a crowd estimated by local media at over four million people, forcing the team to be airlifted by helicopter out of their bus. On 22 December, the French Football Federation confirmed to have lodged a formal complaint against the Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez for unsporting behaviour which included incidents such as a sarcastic prayer for silence for French forward Kylian Mbappé in the Argentine locker room after the match, as well as being seen holding and laughing at a toy with a facial cut of Mbappé's face stuck to it during the Argentine victory parade. In France, riots erupted across the country in cities including Paris, Lyon and Nice; these were very similar to those after their victory in 2018, as well as after victories against England and Morocco earlier in the tournament. Some French players like Kingsley Coman, Randal Kolo Muani and Aurélien Tchouaméni were racially abused online due to their performances by their own fans. The racial abuse the French players received was reminiscent of the racial abuse directed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after their missed penalty kicks in the UEFA Euro 2020 Final saw Italy win that tournament. Within 48 hours of Messi posting, the Instagram post with the World Cup trophy had surpassed 64 million likes, and in doing so, it became the most-liked social media post ever across all social media platforms surpassing the previous most-liked Instagram post, the world record egg."
