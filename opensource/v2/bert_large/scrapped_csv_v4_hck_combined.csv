1,feeling depressed here is how you can cope with post world cup blues,"Post-World Cup depression is a common psychological condition among many football enthusiasts and athletes, which is used to describe the psychological void experienced by fans following the end of a major tournament. Feeling frustrated? Irritated? Losing interest in things what used to make you happy? It could be post-World Cup sadness. The World Cup in Qatar was joyful while it lasted, but after a month of celebrations, Qatar residents are now faced with the overwhelming question of: how do you move on without the World Cup? Whether you are a football fan or not, for Doha residents the past ten years have primarily revolved around the World Cup. Many monuments were built for the major event that did not exist before, from the construction of stadiums to Lusail city. Now that the tournament is over, it is hard to imagine life without the 1.4 million fans who flocked to the streets of Doha a few weeks ago. ‚ÄúBefore the World Cup, there were limited things to do in Qatar,‚Äù Maryam, a therapist at Hamad Hospital told Doha News. ‚ÄúThis event made people try to go to different shows, concerts, etc. It was not just football. It was fashion shows. It was concerts nearly every single day. Food stalls. Meeting new cultures every day. When that‚Äôs taken away from you suddenly, people will obviously react in a sad way,‚Äù she said, explaining why post-World Cup sadness is common after major events. By definition, post-World Cup depression or post-tournament depression is a term that has recently gained popularity, describing the state of mind experienced by fans following the conclusion of the World Cup, which some compare to the feelings of returning to work after a long vacation. According to experts, some of the symptoms that might occur are similar to mild symptoms of depression, which include moodiness, sadness and laziness, in which one may also find themselves avoiding work and tending to spend all their time at home surfing the internet or avoiding people. ‚ÄúPost-World Cup depression is not the same as clinical depression, which is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest that can go on for six months and above,‚Äù Maryam explained; adding that although post-World Cup sadness might develop into severe depression over time, this is generally a seasonal condition when people are trying to cope and transition after a major event. If you‚Äôre a football fan, you probably developed a routine in which you planned your day around the games. However, now that the World Cup has ended, many people are left with nothing to do or look forward to. How to cope with post-World Cup depression According to Trish Bedford, an art-psychotherapist based in Qatar, the first step is to acknowledge that post-World Cup depression is temporary unless you have pre-existing mental health conditions. ‚ÄúFor people who already had mental health issues like anxiety and severe depression before the World began, post-World cup sadness or depression is likely to affect them even more due to different reasons and should seek mental health support,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúBut if you are feeling sad suddenly because your team lost the World Cup or because you are just struggling to go back to a routine after the end of the tournament, then the process is different,‚Äù she said. When a team you support during a tournament score a goal, your brain releases a chemical called dopamine. The routine of watching high-intensity sports over a significant period of time makes your body get used to high dopamine levels, which can make you feel happy and excited. The imminent boredom that follows the end of the tournament decreases dopamine levels, causing depressing feelings including tiredness, mood swings, lack of motivation to do daily tasks and other common symptoms, Bedford explained. ‚ÄúI would recommend doing activities that can increase dopamine or make you feel happy, to avoid falling into a huge depressive episode after,‚Äù she said. Some of activities that can increase your dopamine include, but are not limited to: - Depending on what you like can include: watching movies or going out with friends. This will allow you to have something to look forward to. - Create meaning in your life by planning and adopting a routine. Start with what you can do within a day, give yourself little treats or rewards after accomplishing something on your plan. - Journal or write down how you feel. - Try to relive some of the World Cup moments with your friends and family, depending on what you can tolerate. This includes going through photos and videos you took and creating a memory board, compiled titktok, etc. This allows you to have closure. - Listen to your body and mind. Do you need need physical rest? If you are tired and exhausted, it is important to be kind to yourself and take the time your need. Some Mental health resources in Qatar: - Hamad Medical Corporation is the main provider of mental health care and treatment in Qatar.

2,latest trends story fifa world cup quarter final cristiano ronaldo might be benched again in match against morocco 355713 2022 12 08,"Cristiano Ronaldo may not play for Portugal in the FIFA World Cup 2022 quarter-final match against Morocco. Portugal, which thrashed Switzerland 6-1 in their Round of 16 match, did not include Ronaldo after coach Fernando Santos decided to bench the player. The move was made after Santos learned about Ronaldo's fit after being called to the bench to be substituted. Portugal started brightly without Ronaldo and annihilated the Swiss team in a game that resembled match practice. Ronaldo himself entered the field in the second half but did not add to his tally in this year's FIFA World Cup. When asked about Ronaldo's role following his benching for the Round of 16 game, Santos said it was still being defined. In a press conference, Santos said, ""That is still something that has to be defined. I have a very close relationship with him - I always have, I have known him since he was 19 years old.‚Äù ""This relationship only develops, Ronaldo and I never interpret the human aspect of that of manager and player (in relation to) what we have to do during the match. I will always consider in my role that he is an important player to have in the team,"" the coach added. When asked if he would start against a determined Morocco in the competition's quarterfinal, Santos gave the impression that the player might sit out the contest. ""Ronaldo will definitely (be involved), all the players on the bench can be used, if they are not in the starting line-up they can play later. It is important to look at the example of this player's history, he is one of the best players in the world at playing professionally, being captain - all we have to do is think about this team collectively,"" Santos concluded. Ronaldo came off the bench in the second half to replace Joao Felix as Portugal defeated Switzerland 6-1 at the Lusail Stadium in the round of 16. Georgina Rodriguez, Ronaldo's stunning partner, broke her silence on social media after the 37-year-old Portugal captain was dropped for the match against Switzerland. Georgina chastised Portugal's manager in an Instagram post for not allowing Ronaldo to play for 90 minutes. ""Portugal üáµüáπ‚ô•Ô∏èüíö While the 11 players sang the anthem all goals placed on you. What a shame he didn't get to enjoy the best player in the world for the 90 minutes. The fans haven't stopped claiming you and screaming your name."" ""I hope God and your dear friend Fernando hold hands and make us vibrate one more night,"" her post read.

3,en in news luis enrique spain 1000 penalties training world cup shootout heartbreak blt6882879ff7d633fa,"- Spain practised penalties - Missed all three against Morocco - Lost shootout and exit World Cup WHAT HAPPENED? Spain have been knocked out of the World Cup by Morocco on penalties. The two teams played out a goalless draw which meant spot-kicks were needed to determine the winner. Luis Enrique admitted before the game his side had done plenty of practice, but he could only sit and watch as Carlos Soler, Pablo Sarabia and Sergio Busquets missed all three Spain penalties. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I imagine that they have done their homework. Over a year ago, in one of the Spain camps, I told them they had to get here with at least 1,000 penalties taken. If you wait until getting here to practise penalties... [it won't be enough],"" he told reporters. ""It's a moment of maximum tension, a time to show your nerve and that you can shoot the penalty in the way you have decided, if you have trained it a thousand times. It says a lot about each player. It's trainable, manageable, how you manage the tension. It's increasingly less luck - the goalkeepers have more influence. We have a very good goalkeeper, any of the three can do very well in this situation. Every time we finish training, I see a lot of players taking penalties."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Spain may have done their homework regarding penalties but it certainly didn't pay off in Qatar. Sarabia hit the post with Spain's first spot-kick, while Soler and Busquets were both denied by goalkeeper Yassine Bounou who was the hero for Morocco. Achraf Hakimi then showed Spain exactly how it's done by sealing the win with a cheeky panenka. IN THREE PHOTOS:GettyGettyGetty DID YOU KNOW? Spain have become the first nation in World Cup history to lose four penalty shootouts, while they've become just the second side to not score in one after Switzerland against Ukraine in 2006. WHAT NEXT? Luis Enrique's side will now home after being knocked out of the World Cup. Morocco go on to play either Portugal or Switzerland in the quarter-finals."
4,why india doesnt play fifa world cup,"The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious tournament held every four years and the 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup started on 20th November and will conclude on 18th December 2022. Footballers from across the world have been showcasing their talent for their teams. However, all countries can‚Äôt take part in the FIFA World Cup because there is a limit on the number of teams. There is a huge fan following in India who wants to see their country playing at the World Cup. But this time again, India did not play in Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 because they were eliminated in the second round of the Asian World Cup qualifiers and were placed 3rd in Group E with seven points. Football in India is quite popular and many states in India have regional governing bodies as there are 37 state associations affiliated with the All India Football Federation. Indian football has come a long way and different football clubs and franchises have seen a catastrophic change in the face of the world‚Äôs most loved sport in recent decades. The Suspension of AIFF by FIFA Recently, the Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) suspended the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The sudden suspension came after FIFA suspected undue third-party interference in the management of the AIFF, a breach of FIFA‚Äôs statutes. However, this ban was lifted after a few days, but even then the case was very embarrassing for India. Team India: A ‚ÄúSleeping Giant‚Äù in Football World? In 2006, then FIFA president Sepp Blatter described India as a ‚Äòsleeping giant‚Äô in the football world. From the national team line-up to the domestic tournaments, there have been humongous changes in recent years, but the blue tigers have failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup. The young players from India are doing quite well in domestic leagues and may have won hearts, and attracted huge crowds to their matches, but the fact remains that Indian football still has a long way to go before it can earn the status to play in the FIFA World Cup. Led by Sunil Chhetri, the Indian football team was knocked out in the second round of the qualifying stage. India is in the 106th position in the official ranking of FIFA and even failed to acquire a spot in the top hundred. Many people believe that the biggest reason for India not qualifying for FIFA WC is that football is not as popular as cricket in India. Many people prefer cricket over football, so talent is not recognized. The Indian football team is working hard to be one of the best but less media coverage and inappropriate sponsorship are becoming a big factor in the Indian team‚Äôs game. Also Read  Top 13 Best football shoes  Buy Today for a whole new experience When was the last time India qualified for the FIFA WC? The Indian football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup held in Brazil in 1950 and despite this, the team did not play in the World Cup. India was scheduled against Sweden, Italy, and Paraguay in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. But FIFA banned India from the tournament for ‚Äòdisagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time. But there were rumors that the Indian team wanted to play barefoot but wasn‚Äôt allowed. Since then, India has never qualified for the quadrennial FIFA showpiece. Interestingly, several members of the Indian team competed in the 1948 London Olympic football tournament barefoot, with their feet bound in bandages to prevent injury. Top Reasons Why India is not so popular in the Football World India: The craze for Cricket Over Football The condition of all sports apart from cricket is nearly the same when we consider fan support. Cricket is considered a religion in India as billions of Indians watch and follow cricket. Other leagues like ISL and PKL have been gaining popularity but not as same as IPL. In many games of the Indian national football and a few I-league clubs, the attendance to these games averages around 20k to 40k (except for a few games like the Kolkata derby). It makes a massive difference if you have a huge crowd cheering for you and your team. Also Read  Top 20 Best Futsal Shoes Lack of Infrastructure & Long-Term Vision The Lack of infrastructure and long-term vision are two of the biggest factors creating hindrances in the growth of football in India. India lacks a quality football stadium. Few of the biggest and most popular clubs in India don‚Äôt have proper training and medical facilities. In places like Delhi, and other states where this sport is quite popular, the government needs to establish new football centers and provide training facilities to budding talents. In India, football stadiums with international standards are in fewer numbers as compared to the size of the Indian geographical area and fan following. In India, more than 30 million viewers watch the European Football League so it is high time that Indian football should be promoted at the grassroots level. Promotion of Sport India is always known as a cricketing nation. One of the major reasons that India held a poor ranking in FIFA is because of the lack of proper facilities and awareness about the sport. AIFF has somehow failed in the promotion of football on the global platform. The domestic leagues of football have gained huge popularity in India. The arrival of ISL (Indian Super League) has seen a renewed interest in football among the masses. In India, football is popular in states like Goa, Kerala, Manipur, and West Bengal but most ISL clubs don‚Äôt have proper training facilities and academies.

5,wiki FIFA World Cup Trophy,"FIFA World Cup Trophy Awarded for Winning the FIFA World Cup  Presented by FIFA  History  First award 1930 (Jules Rimet Trophy)  1974 (FIFA World Cup Trophy) First winner  Most wins Brazil (5 times)  Most recent Argentina  Website Fifa.com The World Cup is a solid gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970, before the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. It is one of the most expensive trophies in sporting history, valued at $250,000. The first trophy, originally named Victory, but later renamed in honour of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and lapis lazuli. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil won the trophy outright in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and never recovered. The subsequent trophy, called the ""FIFA World Cup Trophy"", was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 karat gold with bands of malachite on its base, it stands 36.8 centimetres high and weighs 6.175 kilograms (30,875 carats). The trophy was made by the Stabilimento Artistico Bertoni company in Italy. It depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holders of the trophy are Argentina, winners of the 2022 World Cup. Jules Rimet Trophy[edit] The Jules Rimet Trophy was the original prize for winning the FIFA World Cup. Originally called ""Victory"", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base. In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winner's details. It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb). It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup. During World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers' requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture. On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall. It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white mongrel dog named Pickles. As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for ¬£254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of ¬£20,000‚Äì¬£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica. Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester. The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass. On 19 December 1983, the wooden rear of the cabinet was opened by force with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold. Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Z√ºrich headquarters prior to 2015. The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb) of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president Jo√£o Figueiredo in 1984. New trophy[edit] A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) or 30,875 carats of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70‚Äì80 kilograms (150‚Äì180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift. This is easy to understand since 18 k gold is an alloy made of 18 parts of gold, 5 parts of silver and 1 part of copper with a mean density of 15.6 gr/cm3. The trophy weighs 6175 g, this amount of alloy is just a volume of 390 cm3 or, in other words, would be a cube with a side of 7.3 cm, and the World Cup is clearly larger. This argumentation proves that the World Cup is indeed hollow. Moreover, its original manufacturer, who is the same that makes the official replicas, confirmed this characteristic. Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, ""The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory"". The trophy has the engraving ""FIFA World Cup"" on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zurich, Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final. The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition. The Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, however, that is no longer the case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language. For example, ""1974 Deutschland"" or ""1994 Brasil"". In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as ""2010 Spain"", in English, not in Spanish. This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup. As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners. FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. Germany became the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Argentina became the second nation to achieve this feat following their win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Eventual replacement[edit] Since the base of the trophy only has space for new engravings to be made up until the 2038 World Cup, a new trophy will eventually be made for the 2042 World Cup.

6,en news cristiano ronaldo number jersey squad football,"Sir Alex Ferguson convinced Ronaldo to wear the No. 7 shirt after his move to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon. Over the years, several greats; Eric Cantona, George Best and Garrincha to name a few; have graced the No. 7 jersey in football. While each left a mark, none are as synonymous with the iconic number as Cristiano Ronaldo. Doting fans commonly refer to the Portuguese superstar as CR7, which today is nothing short of a global megabrand. Interestingly, Cristiano Ronaldo also owns the CR7 trademark and runs a luxury menswear brand under the banner. But how did Cristiano become associated with the number 7? Here‚Äôs the full story. Why is the number 7 jersey coveted In many cultures around the world, the number seven is considered lucky. So, in many fronts of life, including sports, any involvement with the number is highly sought-after. More often than not, the best or most talented players get their pick of jersey numbers, which has had a cascading effect on the myth of the No. 7 jersey in due time. Watching great players don the No. 7 on the field has only made the number more desirable for future generations. Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs first jersey number was No. 28, given to him after he broke into the Sporting Lisbon first team from the youth setup in 2002. In fact, it was in his jersey No. 28 that Ronaldo turned up for Sporting Lisbon in a pre-season friendly against Manchester United on August 6, 2003. The friendly match was organised to mark the opening of the Estadio Jose Alvalade - Sporting‚Äôs new and current home ground. Ronaldo, at the time just 18, tormented the famous Manchester United defence in the match. Such was the youngster‚Äôs impact in the contest, that Man Utd players thronged Sir Alex Ferguson, the then United manager, and David Gill, then the chief executive, in the team bus and demanded that Cristiano Ronaldo be brought to Old Trafford. A week later, Ronaldo was a Manchester United player. As fate would have it, English superstar David Beckham, who used to occupy United‚Äôs No. 7 jersey before Ronaldo, had left the club for Real Madrid earlier in the same summer transfer window. Manchester United‚Äôs iconic No. 7 jersey, worn over the years by club legends like Bryan Robson, George Best and Eric Cantona, was lying vacant and Sir Alex Ferguson deemed Ronaldo fit to take up the mantle. Cristiano Ronaldo, still barely a teenager at the time, was initially unsure if he was ready to take up such a huge responsibility. Taking over the shirt from Beckham, a Manchester local boy and cult hero, was, after all, a monumental task. But moved by Sir Alex‚Äôs confidence in him, Ronaldo accepted the iconic number. Ronaldo made his Manchester United debut wearing the No. 7 jersey number after coming on as a substitute against Bolton Wanderers in United‚Äôs 2003-04 Premier League season opener at Old Trafford. The rest, as they say, is history. Over his next six seasons at Manchester, Cristiano Ronaldo made the No. 7 shirt his own, helping the Red Devils win the Premier League thrice and the UEFA Champions League once. He also won the Ballon d‚ÄôOr, the first of his five, in 2008. Temporary No. 9 jersey in Real Madrid By the time Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid, his childhood dream club, in 2009, he was already one of the best players in the world. Despite his reputation, though, Cristiano Ronaldo couldn‚Äôt retain the No. 7 jersey after his move to Real Madrid as at the time, it belonged to Raul Gonzalez, a true Madrid local boy and cult hero at the Santiago Bernabeu. Raul, who was also lovingly called El Capitan for captaining both Real and the Spanish national team for years, however, would end up moving on from his boyhood club the next year, allowing Ronaldo to reclaim his beloved No. 7 jersey. In his nine seasons with the Spanish giants, eight with the No. 7 on his back, Ronaldo would go on to score over 450 goals for Real Madrid, becoming the legendary club‚Äôs all-time top goal scorer. Incidentally, CR7 broke Raul‚Äôs record (323 goals) on his way to the top. Ronaldo won two La Liga titles and a whopping four UEFA Champions League trophies with Real Madrid before moving to Serie A giants Juventus in 2018. At the time of his move, Colombia‚Äôs Juan Cuadrado wore the No. 7 shirt for the Old Lady but this time, there was no making Ronaldo wait. Cuadrado promptly vacated the shirt for the Portuguese superstar. Having moved back to Manchester United in 2021, Ronaldo, understandably, retained his No. 7 jersey. Even before staking his claim on the No. 7 at Manchester United, Ronaldo did don the number briefly while representing the Portugal U-17 national team in 2001-02. He switched to No. 11 after his promotion to the U-21 national setup. Ronaldo‚Äôs senior international debut came in August 2003 against Kazakhstan, coming on for Luis Figo as a half-time substitute. The then 18-year-old wore the No. 17 jersey at the time, with Figo, already a Portuguese legend, occupying the No. 7. Cristiano Ronaldo first wore the No. 7 shirt for the senior Portugal football team while playing at the Athens 2004 Olympics but had to wait for a few more years, till Figo‚Äôs retirement in 2006, before staking claim on the Portugal No. 7 jersey full-time."

The 2018 FIFA world cup champions France received $38 million in prize money four years ago, making this year's championship the greatest sum of money FIFA has ever awarded.

11,en news england at fifa world cup 2022 records and stats,"Get all of England's statistics, records, milestones and numbers at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. How are the 'Three Lions' trying to rewrite history? Find out the top facts about Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, Marcus Rashford, coach Gareth Southgate and the rest. The FIFA World Cup 2022 is entering its decisive phase, and England are keen on seizing the moment for more glory at Qatar. After topping their group and beating Senegal 3-0 in the round-of-16, the 'Three Lions' have set up a mouth-watering quarter-final clash with France, hoping to rewrite football history . From captain Harry Kane on the brink of putting himself into England's folklore to Jude Bellingham sprinkling moments of magic in the knockout rounds, the 1966 World Cup winners are leaving their mark on this tournament. Read on to discover which records have already been broken and what beckons for Gareth Southgate and his side. Harry Kane is on the verge of immortality for England as he hones in Wayne Rooney's goalscoring record. The Tottenham Hotspur marksman scored against Senegal to take his goal tally to 52, one away from Rooney's 53 that currently makes him England's top goal-scorer. Perhaps it is a good omen for Kane that the last time he faced France, he netted twice - something that, if he were to replicate on Saturday evening (10 December), would see him reach the holy grail. The 29-year-old was playing alongside Rooney the day he broke Bobby Charlton's record in 2015, and the Manchester United legend told Kane that he believed he would be the successor to his goal-scoring throne. But while the game against Les Blues could be a record-breaking one for the striker, he has already claimed a different one while out in Qatar. His round-of-16 strike made him the highest English goal-scorer in major tournaments with 11, overtaking Gary Lineker's previous record of 10 - making it seven at the World Cup and four at the European Championships. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder has been showing that age is merely just a number when it comes to the big stage, emerging as one of England's standout players so far. The 19-year-old became the first teenager to score for England in this prestegious tournament since Michael Owen in 1998 when he netted the Three Lions' opening goal against the Islamic Republic of Iran in their first outing in Qatar. Yet again, since Owen in '98, Bellingham became the first teenager to start for England in the World Cup knockout phase when he was named in the starting XI to face Senegal. During that round-of-16 tie, he assisted Jordan Henderson's opening goal - making him the first teen to assist in the knockout rounds of this competition since records began. England went on to win that game 3-0, and it was yet another dazzling display from the Dortmund man. Marcus Rashford rightfully stole the headlines when England beat rivals Wales 3-0 in their final game of Group B. The 25-year-old Manchester United forward scored twice on the night, opening England's account with a delightful free-kick from just outside the area. His second came from a venemous strike that flew through Danny Ward's legs and into the back of the net. Not only did it effectively seal the three points, but it also marked England's 100th FIFA World Cup goal. The first goal for the English at the tournament was netted by Stan Mortensen in 1950. Other countries to have scored 100 goals or more at a World Cup include Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain. Not only was England's rampant display against the Islamic Republic of Iran - in which they won 6-2 - a statement victory, it was also an important milestone for manager Gareth Southgate. The three points meant that Southgate has won more matches at major tournaments for the 'Three Lions' than any of his predecessors, including Sir Alf Ramsey who won eight. Another win in the group stage (vs Wales) and first knockout stage (vs Senegal) takes his standing tally to 11. Their last 16 triumph was the sixth knockout game England have won under Southgate's guidance, the same amount they managed to win in the previous 48 years. There has been a record number of draws at the FIFA World Cup 2022 so far, and England and USA played out the fifth goalless encounter on Friday 25 November. Despite both sides having their fair share of chances, neither could find a breakthrough and had to share the points in the end. The occassion marked 22nd draws at World Cups for the 'Three Lions', which is a record. Italy has the second most with 21 draws. Their stalemate with the USA resulted in them hitting a milestone for draws, but England have been firing on all fronts in their other games. In fact, they have scored 12 goals across their four games so far in Qatar, their joint-most at a single major tournament. It equals their tally from the prevous World Cup in 2018, where they went on to bow out in the semi-finals against Croatia. The English will need to be in full goal-scoring flow to beat rivals France in the quarter-finals and reach the semi-finals for a second successive time in this competiton. With a place in the last-eight confirmed, there is still time for England to continue writing their name in the history books - but their biggest test of the tournament is up next. Southgate and his side are set to take on reigning champions France in the quarter-finals, with a place in the last four at stake. That fierce battle will take place on Saturday 10 December, kicking off at 10pm local time. That is 7pm GMT and 8pm CET."
12,football 2022 mar 24 world cup roundup italy north macedonia portugal turkey,"Italy missed out on the World Cup finals again after losing 1-0 at home to North Macedonia in their playoff semi-final as Aleksandar Trajkovski‚Äôs last-gasp strike earned the visitors a famous win. Italy did not qualify for the World Cup four years ago, missing out for the first time since 1958, but the European champions dominated from the off in Palermo. The hosts became more desperate in their search for a winner after the break, however, as chances continued to come and go before, in stoppage time, Trajkovski arrowed in a stunning winner to spark wild North Macedonian celebrations. Roberto Mancini‚Äôs Italy side had 32 efforts at goal in the match but somehow fell short, with North Macedonia going on to play Portugal in the playoff final on Tuesday for a place in Qatar. ‚ÄúIt is a huge disappointment,‚Äù the Italy midfielder Jorginho said. ‚ÄúIt hurts, it hurts so much. We have always created and dominated matches but we have not been able to finish teams off. It is not to blame anyone in particular but it is the reality. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why we haven‚Äôt been able to do this, I am also involved in this, and it hurts me to think about it.‚Äù Without the veteran pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini through injury, Italy‚Äôs makeshift defence was barely troubled in the first half, as all the action took place down the other end. Domenico Berardi had the best of the openings, having been presented with the ball after the North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski misplaced a pass, but his shot was tame, with Dimitrievski getting back to make the save. Ciro Immobile also wasted a glorious first-half chance for Italy when blazing over the bar from a good position. Berardi was again guilty of profligacy after the break, shooting over when he should have hit the target, and with their only meaningful attack of the match North Macedonia seized their chance. Italy did not look to be in too much danger, but Trajkovski, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Fayha, wrote his name into North Macedonian football folklore with a shot that crept inside the post to stun the home fans. Portugal moved into the final with a 3-1 win over Turkey, for whom Burak Yilmaz skied a penalty five minutes from full time that would have drawn the sides level. Roared on by a sold-out Est√°dio do Drag√£o in Porto, Portugal dominated the game from the start and went 2-0 up in the first half after Otavio scored one goal and created another for Diogo Jota before half-time. But Fernando Santos‚Äôs side were pegged back by a Yilmaz goal in the 65th minute that put the Portuguese fans on the edge of their seats as Turkey started to threaten. Jos√© Fonte then fouled Enes Unal inside the area in the 85th minute to concede a penalty given by VAR but Yilmaz fired it high over the bar. The Portugal substitute Matheus Nunes relieved the pressure on the hosts in added time with their third goal from a counterattack. The Sweden substitute Robin Quaison struck in the second half of extra time to secure a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and set up a clash away to Poland. The Czechs had an early goal ruled out for a foul and the Swedes had the lion‚Äôs share of possession for most of the playoff semi-final, but the two sides struggled to break each other down in a game full of tough tackling and wayward passing. The substitute Mattias Svanberg went closest for the Swedes in normal time, but his header from Emil Forsberg‚Äôs corner was aimed straight at the visiting goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik. The game finished scoreless after 90 minutes and appeared to be heading for penalties when Quaison danced through the middle of the defence before exchanging passes with Alexander Isak and coolly slotting home to move his side a step closer to Qatar."

14,wiki Taking the knee,"Taking the knee Taking the knee (or taking a knee) is a symbolic gesture against racism whereby an individual kneels upon one knee in place of standing to attention for an anthem or other such occasion. It was originated by American football player Colin Kaepernick on September 1, 2016, in protest against the lack of attention given to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. Kaepernick's protest led to a wider series of national anthem protests. It has since been adopted by sports players in countries around the world, including association football in the United Kingdom, in solidarity with Kaepernick's protest against racism, and has been seen worldwide in non-sporting contexts such as the Black Lives Matter protests. U.S. national anthem kneeling protests[edit] The gesture originated in a 2016 American football game, during which Colin Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid chose to kneel during the playing of the US national anthem, to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. ""After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest,"" said Reid. ""We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy."" During the 2016 season, a small number of other players also took the knee before matches. Taking a knee became more frequent after then-President Trump criticized the gesture during a rally in September 2017, describing it as a disrespectful act against the United States national anthem and flag, and urging NFL team owners to sack ""son of a bitch"" players who performed it. In response, over a hundred NFL players took the knee in subsequent weeks, along with athletes from other sports, and spectators. Use in association football[edit] Taking the knee was used by many clubs before kick-off throughout the 2020‚Äì21 English association football season, which was booed by some fans. In a June 2020 radio interview, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that he saw the gesture as ""a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation"", adding that he was unaware whether it had a broader history and that it seemed to him to be ""taken from the Game of Thrones"". In September 2020, Middlesbrough said they would stop taking the knee. In December 2020 players from Millwall and QPR said they would not take the knee, but would instead stand arm-in-arm. By February 2021 other teams had stopped taking the knee, including Brentford, while individual players from other teams such as Wilfried Zaha said they would also stop. Zaha later became the first Premier League player to stop taking the knee. Derby County stopped in March 2021. On June 8, 2021, prior to an international friendly game between Hungary and the Republic of Ireland, the Irish players were booed by some Hungarian fans prior to kick-off for taking the knee. The England national team took the knee before matches in 2021's UEFA European Football Championship, resulting in booing from some fans. Conservative MP Lee Anderson stated that he would not watch England games in the tournament as a direct result of this political gesture, saying he believed that ""the vast majority of these fans booing last night are not racist"" and thought they were ""more likely to [...] not share the Marxist views of BLM"". Kick It Out's chief executive Tony Burnett considered the booing an example of racism in the sport. The English Football Association later asked fans to respect the players' wishes to take the knee. England players were booed by Poland fans for kneeling against racism ahead of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at National Stadium, Warsaw. In July 2021, Conservative MP Steve Baker said the Government should start backing players taking the knee, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel had declined to condemn those who booed. Keir Starmer, Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Labour Party, said England's players were ""right to take the knee"". Ahead of the 2022‚Äì23 Premier League season, Premier League club captains agreed to their teams no longer taking the knee routinely before matches, instead restricting the gesture to ""significant moments"" of the season. Some captains felt that the gesture had lost its power, and hoped that restricting it would increase its impact. Captains affirmed their commitment towards fighting racism and other forms of discrimination. During the national anthem to start the 2022 FIFA World Cup game between England and Iran, England players took the knee as Iran‚Äôs players fell silent in reaction to events going on in their country. Similar gestures in history[edit] Josiah Wedgwood pottered the image of a black man kneeling in shackles and depicting slavery on the emblem of the British abolitionist movement during the 18th and 19th centuries‚Äîa movement to ban slavery and ill-treatment of people. In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. knelt in prayer with a group of equalities marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches.

15,en news fifa world cup 2022 records and stats,"Get all the FIFA World Cup 2022 statistics, records, milestones and numbers from Qatar featuring football players Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Dani Alves and more. The FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar came to a dramatic conclusion. This football tournament brought together 32 top national teams from five confederations and produced no shortage of highlights and history. From Cristiano Ronaldo's striking touch to Lionel Messi's World Cup goals and appearances to French superstar Kylian Mbappe, records were made with every passing game. And how about Morocco becoming the first African nation to reach the semi-finals? Read on to discover which records have already been broken and the statistics that are sure to make you the toast of any World Cup conversation. Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) when he netted home a penalty in Portugal‚Äôs 3-2 victory over Group H rivals Ghana. At 37 years and 292 days old on 24 November, with that goal Ronaldo became the oldest player to score for Portugal at the World Cup. He also holds the record for being the youngest, having scored for his nation at the 2006 World Cup at 21 years and 132 days old. In taking to the pitch for the game against Ghana in Qatar, Ronaldo additionally joined Lionel Messi, Lothar Matth√§us, Antonio Carbajal and Rafael M√°rquez as the only men to play in five different FIFA World Cups. But CR7 had to leave Qatar without the coveted trophy after Portugal's shock ext in the quarter-finals after 1-0 loss to Morocco. After scoring a fifth goal of this World Cup against Croatia, and his 11th overall, Lionel Messi smashed a new string of records for Argentina. The 35-year-old is now the top-scorer for Argentina in World Cups, surpassing the previous record of Gabriel Batistuta (10), joint-sixth in all-time World Cup scorer charts, and the oldest man to score five goals in a single World Cup tournament. The semi-final meeting with Croatia also saw him level Lothar Matthaus' record 25 World Cup appearances by a player before he overtook it in the final. In the tournament's opening stages, Messi became the first player to score in four World Cups for Argentina (2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022) after he netted a penalty in an opening-round loss to Saudi Arabia. In the final, he scored from the spot to become the first man to score in each of the knockout stages since the round of 16 was introduced at Mexico 1986. He scored in extra time to make it seven for the tournament and 13 in World Cups. But more than any of that, he lifted the World Cup for the first time in his glorious career. FIFA World Cup 2022: What records has Lionel Messi broken and what records is he closing in on? With 10 minutes to go in the World Cup Final, Argentina led 2-0 with Messi on course for the one trophy to have eluded him. Kylian Mbappe had other ideas. First, he scored from the spot before sweeping home moments later to take the match into extra time. And after his PSG teammate had put Argentina back in front, Mbappe converted another penalty to join Geoff Hurst as the only man to score a hat-trick in the World Cup Final and force a penalty shoot-out. That took Mbappe's tally to eight for the tournament, securing the Golden Boot by one from Messi. He had already eclipsed Pele as the highest World Cup goalscorer before the age of 24. But that incredible effort proved in vain as Argentina won on penalties. Spain‚Äôs No.9 Gavi became the first player born in the year 2004 to score a goal in Qatar when his country thumped Costa Rica 7-0 in their opening match of the tournament. Incidentally, that victory is the record for the most goals Spain has ever scored in a single World Cup match. He's done it! With his goal at the end of the first half of France's round-of-16 clash against Poland, Olivier Giroud became France's all-time leading goalscorer with 52 goals, which he later extended to 53 with his headed winner in the quarter-final against England. The 36-year-old drew level with Thierry Henry's previous mark of 51 when he scored twice in the 4-1 win over Australia. Hot on the heels of Giroud's goal scoring feat, France's captain Hugo Lloris became his nation's record appearance maker. The Tottenham goalkeeper won his 143rd cap in the quarter-final win over England, moving him ahead of Lilian Thuram. Lloris took his tally to 144 in the semi-final against Morocco and then to 145 in the final. Argentina came to Qatar unbeaten in 36 games, singling them out as one of the favourite to win the entire competition. However, that run was shattered by the second-lowest ranked team at the tournament, Saudi Arabia, who defeated Argentina in 2-1. Inaki Williams of Ghana and Nico Williams of Spain made FIFA World Cup history on 24 November after they became the first full siblings to play for different countries at the FIFA World Cup. There's positive record-making and there's the less so, and unfortuantely for hosts Qatar, they claimed a first they might not want to brag too much about. In losing their first match 2-0 Ecuador, Qatar became the first hosts of a FIFA World Cup to lose their opening match. Wales' goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey became the first player at FIFA World Cup 2022 to see a red card after he collided with Iran's Mehdi Taremi. The card shown was initially a yellow before it was upgraded to a red. Hennessey is now the third goalkeeper in World Cup history to be sent off with a red card. England and USA played out the fifth goalless draw of the FIFA World Cup 2022 on Friday (25 November). Six days later, Croatia and Belgium added another 0-0. The other four goalless draws so far: Mexico 0-0 Poland, Denmark 0-0 Tunisia, Croatia 0-0 Morocco and South Korea 0-0 Uruguay. Meaning Qatar 2022 has set another record, eight teams drawing the opening game 0-0 in the same World Cup for the first time ever. England's barren draw was the 22nd draw at World Cups which is a record. Italy is now second with 21 draws. Enner Valencia's goal against the Netherlands was his sixth World Cup goal in a row for Ecuador - no other Ecuadorian player had scored in the meantime. Valencia scored all three of Ecuador's goals in the group stage of the World Cup in 2014. The South American side did not qualify for the 2018 edition in Russia. The 33-year-old joins a select group that includes Portugal's legend Eusebio in 1966, Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Russia's Oleg Salenko in 1994. Robert Lewandowski was in tears after scoring his first World Cup goal in Poland‚Äôs 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia. The Barcelona striker could not hide his emotions after doubling his side's lead with eight minutes remaining to seal victory for his side. The 34-year-old had gone five World Cup games without a goal and missed a penalty in his team‚Äôs opening Group C game against Mexico. Lewandowski now has over 600 career goals and equalled Pele's tally of 77 international strikes. His consolation penalty deep into injury time of the round-of-16 defeat to France saw him go one clear of the Brazilian legend. Portugal's 39-year old centre-back Pepe has become the second oldest outfield player in World Cup after starting in his country's 2-0 win over Uruguay, Cameroon's Roger Milla remains the oldest as he suited up in the World Cup 1994 in the USA aged 42. Egypt's goalie Essam El-Hadary is still the record holder. He was 45 when he played in the World Cup 2018. And Pepe also became the second oldest player to score at a World Cup when he headed in a corner for a 2-0 lead in the 6-1 win over Switzerland. Stephanie Frappart will become the first woman in history to officiate a men's World Cup match when Germany play Costa Rica on Thursday (1 December). The 38-year-old was already the fourth official in Mexico's game with Poland earlier in the tournament. Marcus Rashford was the man of the hour in England's World Cup victory over Group B rivals Wales. The 25-year-old Manchester United player contributed two goals in his country's 3-0 rout s and with his efforts, guaranteed England advanced to the knockout stages on top of their pool. Notably, Rashford's second goal of the game, a left-footed strike that clipped the keeper's heel, was England's 100th FIFA World Cup goal. The first goal for the English at the tournament was netted by Stan Mortensen in 1950. Other countries to have scored 100 goals or more at a World Cup include Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain. 23-year-old Cody Gakpo is the first ever Dutch player to score in all of Netherlands' group stage games at a World Cup. The PSV Eindhoven striker clinched the record when he opened scoring for Netherlands in their third group stage against Qatar on Tuesday (30 November). At 37 years and 247 days old, French goalkeeper Steve Mandanda became the oldest player in history to represent France when he started for Les Bleus against Tunisia on Wednesday 30 November. Dani Alves has accomplished another record in his glittering career. The 39-year-old full-back has become Brazil's oldest captain when he led the record world champion to the field in their clash against Cameroon. 38-year-old Thiago Silva previously held the record for oldest men‚Äôs captain and Brazilian male player to star at a World Cup when he started in Brazil‚Äôs opening round win against Serbia (2-0). Alves has now surpassed him. But Silva made World Cup history on his own as the Chelsea star bagged an assist during Brazil's 4-1 win against the Republic of Korea thus becoming the oldest player to assist a goal at the tournament. Morocco has reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in history after beating Portugal 1-0 on Saturday (10 December). In doing so, the Atlas Lions became the first African country ever to advance to the World Cup semis. They have only conceeded one goal so far. And Morocco are clinical from the spot too, with their goalie Yassine Bounou (aka Bono) saving two penalties in the epic 3-0 shootout win over Spain in the last 16. Achraf Hakimi - born and raised in Madrid - converted the decisive penalty for Morocco. Hard to believe that Walid Regragui only took over as Morocco's coach in August. Gon√ßalo Ramos, who started in place of the benched Cristiano Ronaldo, was the star of the show in the quarter-finals opening the scoring just 17 minutes into his competition debut. The Benfica striker scored the first hat-trick of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and made global headlines. Spanish referee Antonio Lohoz handed out a record 16 yellow cards to players during Argentina's intense quarter-final win over the Netherlands which went to penalties. The previous record was 12 yellow cards which were given out in the games Senegal v Uruguay and Cameroon v Germany in the 2022 World Cup, as well as in the 2010 World Cup final between Span and the Netherlands. Lohoz also yellow-carded Argentina's coach Lionel Scaloni and his assistant coach Walter Samuel. The only player to receive two yellows was Dutch star Denzel Dumfries, the second coming AFTER Lautaro Martinez had converted the decisive penalty in the shootout."
16,qatar becomes first world cup host ever lose opening match 2022 11,"- Qatar set an unwanted record in the first game of the 2022 World Cup on Sunday. - It become the first host nation in the tournament's history to lose its opening match. - F√©lix S√°nchez's side was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador. Qatar became the first host nation of the World Cup to ever lose its opening game at the tournament as it was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador on Sunday. Striker Enner Valencia appeared to have opened the scoring after just three minutes in front of a packed crowd at Al Bayt Stadium, however his header was ruled out for an offside in the build-up. But it didn't take Valencia long to find the net again, this time from the penalty spot in the 16th minute after he was brought down in the box by Qatar keeper Saad Al Sheeb. Valencia then added his and Ecuador's second with a fine header in the 31st minute to complete the scoring. ""Ever since the draw took place I dreamt about this game,"" Valencia, who formerly played in the English Premier League for West Ham United and Everton and whose brace against Qatar saw him become his country's record World Cup goalscorer, told reporters after the match. ""I dreamt about playing in this opening game and winning - so it really is a dream come true. These games are about moments. We were able to score two early goals and it allowed us to take control."" Qatar failed to register a single shot on target in the whole game, with striker Almoez Ali heading wide Qatar's best chance towards the end of the first half. The disappointing performance prompted a large number of the host nation's fans to leave the stadium at the interval. ""It was won in the first half, a poor second half,"" said the former England men's striker turned BBC pundit Alan Shearer. ""Ecuador managed the game, kept the ball when they had to. It was flat in the second half, even the crowd disappeared after half-time."" The former England women's star Alex Scott added: ""The disappointing thing with Qatar was, even when they got some possession, they were so sloppy with it. They gave it away. ""It could be a long group stage for the hosts."" Any hopes of reaching the World Cup knockout phases now look bleak for Qatar. The host, which is 50th in the FIFA world rankings, the third lowest of any team at the World Cup, next faces reigning Africa Cup of Nations champion, 18th ranked Senegal, on November 25. It then faces Netherlands, which is ranked eighth, in its final Group A game on November 29. Fail to make the last-16 and Qatar will become only the second host nation in World Cup history to ever go out at the group stage of the tournament. The other was South Africa in 2010."
17,football fifa world cup news france beats denmark 2 1 champion curse fifa world cup qatar 2022 wc qualify round of 16 article66189062,"France became the first defending World Cup winner to qualify for the round of 16 since Brazil in 2006, in the FIFA World Cup 2022, after it beat Denmark at the Stadium 974 in Qatar, on Saturday. Two second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe, despite a goal from Denmark‚Äôs Andreas Christensen, confirmed its route for the pre-quarterfinals of Qatar 2022. The first goal came just after the hour-mark, when a pass from Theo Hernandez was carried into the box by Mbappe, who finished with ease past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. But the defining moment of the match came in the 86th minute when Antoine Griezmann‚Äôs cross was slotted in by the 23-year-old for his second of the night. With the goal, the Paris Saint-Germain striker became the joint-highest goalscorer in the FIFA World Cup and also the second-highest goal scorer for France in the World Cups, tied with Zinedine Zidane (both seven goals) and just behind Just Fontaine (13 goals). The win breaks the ‚Äòchampion‚Äôs curse‚Äô for the Les Blues, who suffered the wrath of the curse 20 years ago, when it was eliminated in the group stage, after winning the World Cup in 1998. What is the champion‚Äôs curse? Since 1998, European countries winning the FIFA World Cup have failed to make it through beyond the group stages, starting with France, 14 years ago. Italy, the FIFA World Cup 2006 winner was knocked out in the 2010 edition of the tournament, while Spain, winning its maiden World Cup in 2010, was eliminated four years later as well.

Two late goals by Son Heung-min and Kim Young-gwon stunned the defending World Champion as it retuned empty-handed. Why is it called the France curse in the World Cup? It is called the France curse in the World Cup because it started with Les Blues in 1998. Hence, it was poetic justice for France to break the curse, with Didier Deschamps in charge of the side - a man, who was a member of the squad who was first subject to the curse 14 years ago. No World Cup champion has been able to defend the coveted World crown since Brazil in 1962. With France looking a dangerous side, with six goals in two matches so far, it will be hopeful to script history in Qatar this time around"

19,technical football technology football technologies and innovations at the fifa world cup 2022 video assistant referee var,"What is it? A video assistant referee (VAR) system is a support tool for officials. The use of video match officials (VMOs) in football was included in the 2018/2019 edition of the Laws of the Game and was successfully used at the 2018 FIFA World Cup‚Ñ¢. Since then, the system has been implemented in over 100 competitions worldwide. How does it work? The VAR team supports the decision-making process of the referee in four match-changing situations: Goals and offences leading up to a goal Penalty decisions and offences leading up to a penalty decision Direct red card incidents only (not second yellow card/caution) Mistaken identity Throughout a match, the video assistant referee team constantly checks for clear and obvious errors related to these four match-changing situations. The VAR team communicates with the referee only for clear and obvious mistakes or serious missed incidents. Location The video assistant referee team supports the referee from a centralised video operation room (VOR) located in Doha, Qatar. All host broadcaster camera feeds from the eight stadiums are provided to the VOR through a fibre-optic network. The on-field referee at each stadium talks to the VAR team via a sophisticated fibre-linked radio system. Camera set-up The video assistant referee team has access to 42 broadcast cameras, eight of which are super slow motion and four of which are ultra slow motion. Slow-motion replays are mainly used for factual situations, for example, to identify the point of contact of a physical offence or the position of an offence. Normal-speed replays are used for subjective judgements, for example, to determine the intensity of an offence or whether or not a handball was punishable. In addition to the broadcast cameras, the VAR team has access to the camera feeds used by semi-automated offside technology. The VAR team has access to all FIFA host broadcaster camera feeds. As in the past, the feeds (unilateral camera feeds) from cameras installed by Media Rights Licensees (MRLs) are not available to the VAR team. Such cameras generally focus on the team the MRLs represent and are not part of the official host broadcaster‚Äôs camera plan. FWC22 Camera Plan The VAR team The team consists of the video assistant referee (VAR) and three assistant video assistant referees (AVAR1, AVAR2 and AVAR3). All video assistant referee team members are top FIFA video match officials. Three replay operators select and provide the best camera angles. DOHA, QATAR - NOVEMBER 18: FIFA VAR Room/VOR Room 1 in the Football Technology & Innovation (FTI) area at MMC on November 18, 2022 in Doha, Qatar. (Photo by Mark Metcalfe - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images) VAR: The VAR watches the main camera on the upper monitor and checks or reviews incidents on the quad-split monitor. Moreover, the VAR is responsible for leading the VAR team and communicating with the on-field referee. AVAR1: The AVAR1 concentrates on the main camera and keeps the VAR informed about live play if an incident is being checked or reviewed. AVAR2: The AVAR2 is a video match official with an assistant referee background and is located at the offside station and checks any potential offside situations, with the help of semi-automated offside technology, to speed up the VAR check and review process. AVAR3: The AVAR3 focuses on the TV programme feed, assists the VAR in evaluating incidents and ensures good communication between the VAR and the AVAR2 located at the offside station. Referee review area The referee review area (RRA) is a clearly marked area containing a screen that allows the referee to review incidents. It is located pitchside, close to the technical areas. VAR information for fans To ensure that all fans in the stadium and watching on TV or mobile devices are well informed during a review process, FIFA has developed a VAR information system for broadcasters, commentators and infotainment. For each match, a FIFA staff member informs the broadcasters, commentators and infotainment about the different steps of the review process, including the reason for and outcome of the review, via a networked touch tablet. The person operating the tablet is located in the video operation room and has access to the camera angles the VAR is looking at. The VAR information system will also be used to automatically create VAR-specific graphic templates for TV and the giant screen in the stadium. How was it tested? The VAR system from the technology provider Hawk-Eye Innovations Limited was successfully tested by the independent test institute RISE AB according to the existing global standard of the FIFA Quality Programme. The installed VAR set-up for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar was tested during validation matches before the start of the tournament in each competition stadium. FAQsÔªø Here you can find answers and further clarification to the most frequently asked questions. Does the VAR team have access to the goal-line technology signal? Yes, the video match officials have access to the goal-line technology signal and to the high-speed cameras positioned in line with the goal line. what happens if the technology does not work? FIFA has implemented backup plans in case there are problems with the technology. In the event that VAR technology does not work, the referee and the teams will be informed, and the match will continue. What cameras are used for offside incidents? At the FIFA World Cup 2022‚Ñ¢, the video match officials will use semi-automated offside technology. Twelve dedicated electronic performance and tracking system cameras will be used so that the automatically selected kick point and the automatically provided offside lines can be reviewed by the video match officials."
20,football fifa world cup story 4823432 cameroon give this world cup another shock by beating brazil,"  LUSAIL, Qatar -- Cameroon's Vincent Aboubakar scored a late winner to hand them a memorable 1-0 win over Brazil on Friday, but it was not enough to see Rigobert Song's side through to the knockout stages of Qatar 2022. - World Cup 2022: News and features  Schedule  Squads Brazil dominated much of the match, but Aboubakar's 90th-minute winner ensured Cameroon's World Cup campaign finished on a winning note. He celebrated by taking his shirt off and was subsequently sent off by referee Ismail Elfath, who handed the striker a second yellow card for his celebration following another booking earlier in the match. With qualification already secured, Brazil manager Tite made nine changes to his side ahead of the match and handed Dani Alves the captaincy, and while they head through as winners of Group G, this was a shock result and not the preparation they wanted ahead of their round-of-16 matchup against South Korea on Monday. JUMP TO: Player ratings  Best/worst performers  Highlights and notable moments  Postmatch quotes  Key stats  Upcoming fixtures Rapid reaction 1. Cameroon give this World Cup another shock Tite's much-changed Brazil side gave the fresh starters a wonderful opportunity to give the manager a selection headache ahead of the round of 16. A couple took it, while others let it pass them by. Regardless of the changes, Brazil's expectations remain the same: they anticipated and demanded a win. In a World Cup of shocks, this was another to add to the list. The swathes of changes represented Tite reinforcing the faith he has in the whole squad to get the job done here in Qatar. Only third-choice keeper Weverson is yet to get any minutes. But the selection gamble, in the short term at least, didn't pay off. Of those brought in, it was the Arsenal man Gabriel Martinelli who was Brazil's best player on the field as his trickery caused Cameroon a headache. Twice he managed to slip past his marker to get shots on goal, and it was only the astute positioning of goalkeeper Devis Epassy that kept them out. There were those who failed to make the most of their opportunity, though. Gabriel Jesus never really managed to fashion a chance -- replaced after 54 minutes by Everton Ribeiro -- but did well in link-up play. On the opposite flank to Martinelli, Antony showed flashes of brilliance in the opening stages but was eventually marked out of the game by the Seattle Sounders' Tolo Nouhou. Rodrygo was one of the more promising players off the bench in Brazil's 1-0 win over Switzerland but was handed some rough justice by the Cameroon defence and didn't manage to trouble the goal. Their profligacy ended up costing them, while it was a defensive lapse that allowed Aboubakar to head home unmarked late on with Bremer missing his man. That will give Tite cause for concern with South Korea lying in wait and the injured personnel watching on from the stands. For Brazil, the focus was on those in the stands or unused on the bench as much as on those on the field. Neymar was present in the stadium as he continues recovery from an ankle injury -- the sight of him drew huge cheers from the Brazil fans who packed Lusail Stadium -- while Danilo and Alex Sandro were also there. Given that Alex Telles was forced off injured in the early stages of the second half, Brazil will be hoping Alex Sandro is available for the next phase. The signs are promising there, but the breadth of the squad's reserves in defence was tested here with Marquinhos ending up as a makeshift left-back. For those who wanted to force their way into the starting lineup, the majority failed to take their chance. 2. Cameroon impress despite group stage exit Cameroon needed a victory against Brazil and results elsewhere to go their way if they were to progress to the knockout rounds, but despite getting the job done their turbulent World Cup ends at the group stage. Considering they started with a lacklustre 1-0 defeat to Switzerland, then had to cope with the scandal surrounding goalkeeper Andre Onana's departure, the fact that they rallied and were still in with a shout of making the round of 16 heading into the final game was credit to them. Their heroics against Serbia -- when they came back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 -- gave them the platform to create history against Brazil. They were patient. For so much of the match they had their backs against the wall. Up until Aboubakar's late winner, the closest they came was Bryan Mbeumo's header on the stroke of half-time, which needed a world-class save from Ederson to be kept out. The script was similar in the second half, as they repelled anything and everything Brazil threw at them. And credit has to go the players and manager for their defensive organisation. Given they were without their two first-choice centre-backs for the game -- both Jean-Charles Castelletto and Nicolas Nkoulou were injured -- the fact they managed to keep out Brazil was a great effort. And in the absence of Onana, Epassy put in a monumental performance in goal. He was sensational in keeping out the Brazilian waves of attack. It all gave Aboubakar his shot at history. 3. Dani Alves makes Brazilian men's World Cup history The ageless Dani Alves cemented his place in Brazilian football history as he became the oldest men's player to represent his country in a World Cup. He captained the side, and aged 39 years and 210 days, he overtook the previous record held by fellow right-back Djalma Santos, who was 37 back at the 1966 World Cup. Alves' inclusion in the 26-man squad was questioned. Tite came in for heavy criticism for picking the veteran, given Alves was struggling with a knee injury and is in the twilight of his career. But the manager -- in his own, soft-spoken way -- backed the former Barcelona stalwart, saying full-backs in his system don't necessarily need grass-scorching speed, and the 39-year-old had other qualities that would be invaluable. The man himself said prematch that he would be happy just playing the tambourine to maintain morale, but he proved against Cameroon that he isn't here merely to make up the numbers. He did well keeping threats from his flank at bay for so much of the match, and given Brazil's injuries at full-back will likely be called upon at some stage against South Korea in the round of 16. Player ratings Cameroon: Devis Epassy 8, Collins Fai 7, Enzo Ebosse 7, Christopher Wooh 7, Tolo Nouhou 7, Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu 6, Pierre Kunde 6, Andr√©-Frank Zambo Anguissa 8, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting 7, Bryan Mbeumo 6, Vincent Aboubakar 7 Subs: Karl Toko Ekambi 6, Olivier Ntcham 6, Jerome Ngom Mbekeli 6 Brazil: Ederson 7, Dani Alves 7, Bremer 7, √âder Milit√£o 7, Alex Telles 6, Fabinho 7, Fred 6, Rodrygo 6, Antony 7, Gabriel Martinelli 8, Gabriel Jesus 6 Subs: Bruno Guimar√£es 6, Marquinhos 6, √âverton Ribeiro 6, Pedro 6, Raphinha 6 Best and worst performers BEST: Devis Epassy, Cameroon. The Abha No. 1 was monumental in goal for Cameroon. He stopped anything and everything thrown his way. WORST: Gabriel Jesus, Brazil. Tricky, this one, but the Arsenal forward failed to put his stamp on the game. Highlights and notable moments With Brazil legend Pele in hospital suffering from a respiratory infection, Selecao fans sent the former Santos star their best. Even Ismail Elfath felt bad having to send off Aboubakar. After the match: What the players and managers said Epassy: ""We can be proud of what we did tonight as it showed we can be a top team. We didn't qualify, though, which is why we're not overly happy with tonight."" Fabinho: ""If you don't kill [the game], the opponent only needs one chance. This is what happened. Thankfully, we finished top of the group. It was not a loss that eliminated us but we can still learn from it. We created a lot but we can't miss so many goals."" Key stats (provided by ESPN Stats & Information) - Mbeumo's shot on goal in the third minute of first-half stoppage time was the first shot on goal Brazil have faced this World Cup. - Aboubakar is the first player to be sent off from a game for excessive celebration in a World Cup match going back to at least 1966. - Cameroon ended Brazil's World Cup group stage unbeaten streak at 17 games. Prior to Friday, they hadn't lost in this phase of the competition since 1998 when Norway defeated them. Up next Cameroon: Cameroon's World Cup is over, but they'll be back in action in March, when they host Namibia for Africa Cup of Nations qualifying March 20. Brazil: The Selecao will take on South Korea on Monday in the round of 16."

22,football portugal por story 4805137 cristiano ronaldo becomes first man to score in 5 world cups,"  Cristiano Ronaldo made history Thursday as the first male player to score in five World Cups in Portugal's opening game in Qatar against Ghana. The Portugal captain scored in the 65th minute from the penalty spot -- the 118th goal for his country -- to open the scoring at Doha's Stadium 974. Portugal went on to win 3-2 as goals from Joao Felix and Rafael Leao helped them weather two late efforts from Ghana. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Ronaldo, 37, is the most prolific goal scorer in men's international football and has made a record 18 appearances for Portugal at a World Cup. ""It's a beautiful moment, in my fifth World Cup. We won, we started off on the right foot, a very important victory,"" Ronaldo said of the milestone. ""We know that in these competitions winning the first game is crucial. Another record too, the only player to score in five consecutive World Cups, that for me it is a reason of great pride. ""I am very happy for the team to have given an excellent performance. Difficult, but fair win. ""The important thing was that the team won. The [Manchester United] chapter is closed, and the focus is solely and exclusively on the World Cup. As I said, we wanted to start off on the right foot. We won, we played well, I helped the team. Everything else is not important. The important thing is the national team."" His latest landmark comes after he left Manchester United by ""mutual agreement"" earlier this week following an explosive TV interview in which he criticised the club and coach Erik ten Hag. The forward made his Portugal debut in 2003 and scored his first goal 10 months later during a Euro 2004 group stage game against Greece. His first World Cup goal, in 2006, was from the penalty spot in a 2-0 win over Iran. His next World Cup goal came four years later in South Africa in a 7-0 rout of North Korea. Ronaldo also scored in Portugal's 2-1 win over Ghana in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but his side faced disappointment as they were eliminated in the group stage. - The VAR review: Why Ronaldo's penalty didn't get full review The first player to score in five World Cups, men's or women's, was Marta in 2019, and Christine Sinclair matched the feat that same year. Ronaldo's most successful World Cup campaign was in 2018 in Russia, where he scored four goals, including a hat trick in a 3-3 draw with Spain. The last of those goals came in the 88th minute, a 25-yard free-kick that flew into the top left corner past United teammate David de Gea. Portugal's best performance with Ronaldo was the 2006 World Cup, when they finished fourth. By scoring in Thursday's Group H game against Ghana, his eighth goal at a World Cup, he is one strike from equalling the country's record in the competition, set by Portugal legend Eusebio. Eusebio helped Portugal reach third place at the 1966 World Cup in London, where he finished as the top scorer with nine goals. Ronaldo's finest hour in international football came when he captained Portugal to Euro 2016 glory against hosts France with a 1-0 victory. It was Portugal's first major title, and it was followed by UEFA Nations League glory three years later. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote on Instagram: ""Very important win in our World Cup opener but nothing is won! It was just the first step! We remain focused on the pursuit of our objectives. Strength Portugal!"""

24,football fifa world cup news germany cover mouth japan game onelove armband controversy protest fifa world cup qatar wc infantino article66174425,"German players covered their mouths during their team photo prior to their Group E game against Japan, in order to mark their protest on their captain, Manuel Neuer being denied permission to wear the ‚ÄòOneLove‚Äô armband for the Qatar World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was present for the game, when this happened. DFB, the Germany football association, soon released a statement regarding the protest: ‚ÄúWe wanted to use our captain‚Äôs armband to take a stand for values that we hold in the Germany national team: diversity and mutual respect.‚Äù ‚ÄúTogether with other nations, we wanted our voice to be heard. It wasn‚Äôt about making a political statement ‚Äì human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn‚Äôt the case. That‚Äôs why this message is so important to us. Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position,‚Äù added DFB in the statement. Nancy Faeser, the German minister of the Interior and Community, was seen along with German Football Association President Bernd Neuendorf, wearing the ‚ÄòOneLove‚Äô armband in the stands Earlier this week, Football Associations of seven nations released a joint statement, advising their players against wearing the ‚ÄòOneLove‚Äô armband. The armband represents support for equality and while it is not solely aimed at the rights of the LGBTQ community, it is significant in Qatar where homosexuality is illegal. ‚ÄúWe are very frustrated by the FIFA decision which we believe is unprecedented - we wrote to FIFA in September informing them of our wish to wear OneLove armband to actively support inclusion in football and had no response‚Äù said the joint statement of seven nations which includes England , the Netherlands, Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. Neuer, along with the captains of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, England, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales, were reportedly set to wear the One Love armband during this edition of FIFA World Cup which commenced on November 20."
25,football fifa world cup story 4823867 no 1 not veteran eiji kawashima remains loyal japan cause even with change role samurai blue,"  DOHA, Qatar -- Having made his international debut in 2008, it did not take long for Eiji Kawashima to establish himself as Japan's first-choice goalkeeper. Two years later, he would feature for the Samurai Blue at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa -- the first of four consecutive tournaments he would be present at with Kawashima currently part of the squad at Qatar 2022. Things are slightly different for him this time around though. Having been -- quite literally -- the first name on the Japan starting XI at the past three editions of the World Cup, Kawashima is now only No. 1 in jersey allocation with Shuichi Gonda currently the main man in goal for coach Hajime Moriyasu. The fact that the Strasbourg man is playing a lesser role these days is hardly surprising considering he will turn 40 in March, although he remains in supreme condition, and is no longer getting as much regular first-team football at club level as would be expected from a national team's starting goalkeeper. Yet, that does not mean Kawashima has not been performing his role for the team in a remarkable campaign thus far, which has seen them claim dramatic come-from-behind wins over powerhouses Germany and Spain to reach the Round of 16 for the second consecutive tournament. Having always displayed quiet but firm leadership qualities, the sheer experience of the Saitama native makes him a calming presence in the dressing room and a pillar of support for the younger members of the playing group. In the immediate aftermath of Japan's win over Spain, when it looked like the frenzy of photographers clicking away by the sidelines was at risk of spilling over and into the players on their lap of honour, the powerfully-built 1.85 metre Kawashima was almost playing the role of half-protective big brother, half-menacing bodyguard -- ensuring no harm was going to befall the likes of Takefusa Kubo and Ritsu Doan. From the warmups in training and before matches, Kawashima almost doubles up as a second goalkeeping coach for Gonda and the bond between them -- and the third option in Daniel Schmidt -- has been emblematic of the 'goalkeepers' union' -- best illustrated when the reserve duo wildly charged straight towards the first-choice to celebrate at the final whistle of Thursday's triumph over the Spanish. Perhaps most importantly, his sheer availability will help keep Moriyasu's mind at ease, knowing he has a seasoned campaigner ready to be called upon whenever the need arises. ""For sure (this World Cup has been different). For the last three World Cups, I played in all the games,"" Kawashima told ESPN exclusively. ""But I'm always loyal for the Japanese national team because it is always an honour to be here. ""I'm really excited to be part of this team and what we're achieving, including this amazing result (against Spain). So I just try to give my everything to this team. ""It's been really amazing. This group was really tough -- we had Germany and Spain. It was difficult but we believed in ourselves and it has been a good result."" Known for being fluent in seven languages, the well-spoken Kawashima has exuded a sense of maturity and being grounded even in his younger days. His ability to accept the fact that he now has to settle for a back-up role behind Gonda could easily stem from the fact that he was once on the other side of the equation -- back at the 2010 World Cup when he was expected to be an emergency option for the Samurai Blue but ended up being promoted to the starting XI ahead of two veterans in the presumed No. 1 Seigo Narazaki and legendary captain Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi. It is this very quality of being level-headed that is also keeping him from getting overly carried away with what the Japanese have achieved so far in Qatar. ""No, no, no -- we've got to win game by game,"" Kawashima hastily dismissed, when asked if they could start dreaming of potentially getting to a World Cup final. ""Now we're really confident but also modest. We know our potential, we believe that we can do something. ""We believed in ourselves (that we could beat Spain) -- that was our goal. Now, for sure the next game (against Croatia) will be a difficult game too, but we'll try to do our best."" That much is for certain. Whether it has been in one of those 95 caps he has already won for Japan, or more recently on the sidelines as a figure of leadership and support for his younger peers, Kawashima can always be counted on to do his best for the Samurai Blue cause."
26,VAR technological innovation,"As the official match ball of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar, Al Rihla is one of the most important technological innovations of the tournament. Inside the ball is the Adidas Suspension System which includes a 500Hz inertial measurement unit motion sensor that sends out data 500 times per second. The sensor provides unprecedented insight into every element of the movement of the ball and is powered by a rechargeable battery. The technology is unnoticeable for players and does not affect the balls‚Äô performance. The balls‚Äô data assists in detecting unclear touches to improve the quality and speed of VAR (Video Assistant Referees) decision-making and semi-automated offside technology. As Dr. Maximilian Schmidt, the Global Sports Lead at KINEXON, explained, ‚Äú‚Ä¶our goal with Adidas is to use state-of-the-art technology to improve the experience for everyone involved without changing the game of football. We are confident that with accurate live ball data the connected ball technology will enable a new age of football analytics and fan experience.‚Äù Semi-automated offside technology in use for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar Every soccer fan is well aware of the offside rule. The rule has changed numerous times throughout history, is subjective by nature, and has determined the outcome of many matches. To enable video and on-field match officials to make faster, more accurate, and more reproducible offside decisions, Qatar 2022 is implementing semi-automated offside technology. The technology uses twelve dedicated cameras mounted underneath the stadiums‚Äô roofs to track the ball and up to 29 data points of each player, 50 times per second. The 29 collected data points include all limbs and extremities relevant for offside calls. Additionally, as aforementioned, Al Rihla collects data 500 times per second to allow for precise detection of the kick point. Using artificial intelligence, the limb- and ball-tracking data provides an automated offside alert to the video match officials whenever an attacker is in an offside position when a ball is played by a teammate. Video match officials must manually check the data, and the referee on the pitch must confirm the decision. The positional data points used to make the decision is generated into a 3D animation that is shown on the stadiums‚Äô screens and made available to FIFA‚Äôs broadcast partners to further explain the call. For the first time, players in the 2022 FIFA World Cup will have access to a FIFA Player App. Developed based on input from professional players, the app gives players insights into their on-field and player performance data shortly after each match. The FIFA Player App includes enhanced data and intelligence metrics captured by a team of expert FIFA performance analysts and tracking data. This takes into account whether a player moved to receive the ball, the pressure they applied to an opponent, receiving locations, and more. The app also consists of physical performance metrics collected through in-stadium tracking. For example, the app displays the distance covered at various speed thresholds, the number of actions over 25 km/h (about 15 miles per hour), and the maximum speed. Bonocle and Feelix Palm Bonocle device for a more accessible World Cup Photo Credit: Bonocle To enable visually-impaired fans to enjoy the 2022 FIFI World Cup, Bonocle and Feelix Palm are used. Bonocle is the world‚Äôs first Braille entertainment platform. By using transcoding functionalities and Bluetooth technologies, individuals with visual impairments can experience the excitement of the World Cup just like everyone else. As Boncole‚Äôs founders described, ‚ÄúBonocle will enable the blind community all over the world to experience the World Cup in 2022 in new ways that were never available before‚Ä¶It will remove the barriers that have kept blind people restricted and open doors for them to explore new things and new places.‚Äù Feelix Palm, a palm communicator with tactile features, will also be used in Qatar. By using electric impulses, Feelix Palm offers braille-like messages to the visually impaired without restricting their physical movement or hearing. Advanced Stadium Cooling Technology As for a sustainable technology innovation, seven of the eight stadiums of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar feature advanced cooling technology to keep the stadium at about 68¬∞ F, an ideal temperature for players and fans. Estimated to be 40 percent more sustainable and energy-efficient as compared to conventional cooling techniques, the cooling system uses a combination of insulation and targeted cooling to cool only places where people are. Dr. Saud Abdulaziz Abdul Ghani, now nicknamed Dr. Cool, is the mastermind behind this immense task. He explained, ‚ÄúThe biggest thing working against you when you‚Äôre trying to cool a stadium is the opening of the stadium‚Äôs roof because that is where external hot air enters. That‚Äôs why studying where air can exit and how we can push and pull back air differs from stadium to stadium as it depends on its shape, height, and width.‚Äù To adjust to this challenge, the stadiums are designed for cooled air to come through in grills in the stands and large nozzles on the pitch. Through an air circulation technique, warm air is sucked into the stadium‚Äôs cooling system, cleaned by water, re-cooled, filtered out, and pumped out again by the jets. This also purifies the air. Further ensuring fans‚Äô comfort, under-seat diffusers push air out at an angle to deliver it gently. Additionally, sensors around the stadium will keep the temperature constant and adjust air flows for seats in the shade or sun."

A total of 32 teams will be seen in action across a span of one month, with the final scheduled to be played on December 18. This is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world, and the last to feature 32 teams. From the next edition in 2026, the number of participating teams will increase to 48. France is the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4‚Äì2 in the 2018 final. Here are 10 interesting facts about the 2022 Qatar World Cup. As per Bloomberg, Qatar has spent a whopping $300 billion (Rs 2442000 crore) to organise the World Cup. As per Economic Times, the construction of new stadiums cost $6.5 billion (Rs 530 crore). In comparison, Russia had spent only $14.2 billion (Rs 115913 crore) to organise the 2018 World Cup, per Forbes. The Qatar World Cup will be played across 28 days, which makes it the shortest football World Cup since 1998. Since the World Cup became a 32-team tournament in 1998, the 2014 edition in Brazil was held over 32 days while the shortest 32-team World Cup was played across 31 days. The opening match of the 2022 World Cup was played on November 20, with the final to be held on December 18.

However, they lost their opening game to Ecuador. This is the first time that the football World Cup is being played in the months of November and December instead of May, June, or July. Summers in Qatar get harsh, which is why the tournament has been held in winter when the weather is pleasant. This, however, has played a spoilsport to the European league schedules. 18-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko of Germany is the youngest player at the 2022 World Cup. At the Bundesliga in 2022, he helped Borussia Dortmund with three assists and six goals. The oldest player, meanwhile, is Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary, aged 45. As per The Hindu, more than 1.5 million people applied for the compulsory pass for the tournament. The pass serves as a visa, transport and match ticket and gives access to fan zones. The two international airports in Doha are prepared to handle 150,000 entries a day during the course of the tournament. As per Bloomberg, nearly 3 million tickets had been sold by mid-October. As per TOI, as many as five billion people are expected to tune in to watch the 2022 World Cup. That is more than half of the world‚Äôs population!

29,wiki List of FIFA World Cup hat tricks,"List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. A hat-trick occurs when a player scores three or more goals in a single match and it is considered an achievement, especially while playing at the largest international football tournament in the world. Across the over 800 matches at the 22 tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, 54 hat-tricks have been scored. The first hat-trick was scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States, playing against Paraguay in 1930; the most recent was by Kylian Mbapp√© of France, playing against Argentina on 18 December 2022. The only World Cup not to have at least one hat-trick scored was the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The record number of hat-tricks in a single World Cup tournament is eight, during the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland. 19 players have scored a hat-trick in the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. Two were playing in their first ever World Cup match, Edmund Conen and Angelo Schiavio, both in 1934, a tournament without a group stage. Geoff Hurst (1966) & Kylian Mbapp√© (2022) are the only players to have scored a hat-trick in the final.

For notable hat-tricks at the Women's World Cup, see List of FIFA Women's World Cup hat-tricks#Notable World Cup hat-tricks. - Bert Patenaude was the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, on 17 July 1930 against Paraguay. However, until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo St√°bile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude. In 2006, FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as teammate Tom Florie's goal in the match against Paraguay was re-attributed to him. - Four players have scored two hat-tricks in World Cup matches: S√°ndor Kocsis (both 1954); Just Fontaine (both 1958); Gerd M√ºller (both 1970); and Gabriel Batistuta (1994 and 1998). Batistuta is thus the only person to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record of scoring hat-tricks, both were achieved on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty. Kocsis and M√ºller scored their hat-tricks in consecutive matches. - Oleg Salenko is the only player in World Cup history to have scored five goals in a single match. He did this during the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Russia and Cameroon. - One player has scored a hat-trick on his international d√©but: Guillermo St√°bile (1930). - One player has scored four goals for the losing side: Ernst Wilimowski (5‚Äì6, 1938). - Three other players have scored a hat-trick for the losing side: Josef H√ºgi (5‚Äì7, 1954), Kylian Mbappe (3‚Äì3, losing 4‚Äì2 on penalties, 2022), and Igor Belanov (3‚Äì4, 1986). - One other player has scored a hat-trick in a game that his side did not win: Cristiano Ronaldo (3‚Äì3, 2018) - There have been three occasions when two hat-tricks have been scored in the same match. Two occurred during the 1938 FIFA World Cup: when Sweden defeated Cuba, Gustav Wetterstr√∂m and Harry Andersson, both playing for Sweden, scored three goals, with the former completing his in the first half. In the Brazil vs Poland, Le√¥nidas did it for Brazil and Ernst Wilimowski for Poland. One occurred in 1954: when Austria defeated Switzerland, Theodor Wagner and Josef H√ºgi scored hat-tricks for Austria and Switzerland respectively. - Two players have scored hat-tricks in World Cup Finals. Geoff Hurst scored three goals for England against West Germany in the 1966 Final. This is also the longest hat-trick to be completed ‚Äî most time between the first and third goals. His first goal came at 18', while the second and third goals were in extra time at 98' and 120'. Kylian Mbapp√© scored the other World Cup finals' hat-trick in the 2022 FIFA World Cup final for France against Argentina. His goals were scored at the 80th, 81st and 118th minute marks. Two of his goals - 80th and 118th - were successful penalty kicks. - The quickest hat-trick by a player is Erich Probst, who scored at 4', 21', and 24' in 1954, playing for Austria against Czechoslovakia in the first round. - The briefest hat-trick to be completed ‚Äî that is, the shortest time between the first and third goals ‚Äî is the one by L√°szl√≥ Kiss in 1982 against El Salvador. He scored at 69', 72', and 76', making the time between his first and third 7 minutes. This is also the only hat-trick scored by a substitute. - The only players to have scored from three headers in a single match are Tom√°≈° Skuhrav√Ω in 1990 and Miroslav Klose in 2002. - The youngest player to score a hat-trick is Pel√©, at 17 years, 244 days. - The oldest player to score a hat-trick is Cristiano Ronaldo, at 33 years, 130 days. - Germany (incl. West Germany) holds the record for most hat-tricks scored with 7. Germany also shares with South Korea the record for most hat-tricks conceded with 4.

30,fifaplus en articles cameroon brazil first victory africa fifa world cup qatar 2022,"Cameroon crack the Brazilian barrier for Africa An Afircan side had never beaten Brazil at the FIFA World Cup. The Indomitable Lions rewrote history at the Lusail. LUSAIL CITY, QATAR - DECEMBER 02: Vincent Aboubakar of Cameroon celebrates after scoring the team's first goal during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Group G match between Cameroon and Brazil at Lusail Stadium on December 02, 2022 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Michael Regan - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images) An African team had never beaten Brazil at the FIFA World Cup Cameroon ended the drought with a stunning victory at the Lusail Vincent Aboubakar and Rigobert Song hailed the victoryÔªø Five nations had tried. They‚Äôd had seven attempts between them. Those tilts had been led by continental demigods such as Roger Milla, Mustapha Hadji, Asamoah Gyan, Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba. Yet an African team had never beaten Brazil in the FIFA World Cup‚Ñ¢. In truth, they‚Äôd never even come close. A Sele√ß√£o had won all seven of those games, scoring 20 goals and conceding just two in the process. Lusail Stadium would be the setting for statistic amplification. Cameroon were, after all, on a run of one point from a possible 27 at the World Cup, coming close to equalling Mexico‚Äôs competition record for consecutive losses (nine). They‚Äôd registered just one victory ‚Äì 1-0 over Saudi Arabia in 2002 ‚Äì since Milla punished Rene Higuita and Colombia 32 years ago. Cameroon: Their previous South American victories Rewatch Cameroon's previous victories at the FIFA World Cup‚Ñ¢ over South American sides, after they became the first African side to defeat Brazil. They didn‚Äôt have a player fit enough to lace the boots of Thomas N'Kono, Theophile Abega, Milla, Joseph-Antoine Bell, Patrick M'Boma or Samuel Eto‚Äôo. The Indomitable Lions weren‚Äôt so indomitable anymore. Besides, Brazil hadn't lost a group-stage game in 24 years and this wasn‚Äôt just any Brazil side. It was the tournament favourites. The beatdown would commence on Facundo Tello‚Äôs whistle. And so it did. Gabriel Martinelli began driving at them down the left. Antony was doing the same on the right. They nevertheless ran into an indomitable wall. Goalkeeper Devis Epassy, and centre-backs Enzo Ebosse and Christopher Wooh, went into this tournament with 14 caps cumulatively, and all began it on the bench. They were all, however, infallible as Cameroon did the impossible: stopped Brazil scoring. A save of the tournament contender by Ederson from Bryan Mbeumo looked to have ensured Brazil would also stop Cameroon scoring. Then, in second-half stoppage time, an exceptional Jerome Ngom Mbekeli cross was clinically headed into the bottom corner by Vincent Aboubakar. Cameroon v Brazil  Group G  FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022‚Ñ¢  Highlights Watch the highlights from the match between Cameroon and Brazil played at Lusail Stadium, Lusail on Friday, 02 December 2022. Tello‚Äôs last whistle at the Lusail wrote an African miracle into the record books. An African side, at the eighth time of asking, had finally avoided defeat against Brazil. Furthermore, Cameroon had defeated the five-time world champions. Unfortunately for the Indomitable Lions, four points in Group G was insufficient to sneak them through the survivors‚Äô gate. Still, they can look back on one of the greatest results Africa has ever produced in this competition. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of my players,‚Äù said Rigobert Song. ‚ÄúThis is such a historic result. My players deserve all the congratulations. ‚ÄúOf course we have regrets. We wanted to go through. But we also need to look on the positive side. This is a huge result for Cameroon, for Africa. ‚ÄúI have been trying to instil a team spirit, a lion‚Äôs spirit, and I think you could see this. We go home, but we go home having beaten Brazil and shown that we are a match for anyone.‚Äù Aboubakar added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame the other result didn‚Äôt go our way, but we can go home with our heads held high. It had been years since Cameroon achieved a victory in the World Cup. ‚ÄúIt was a great win and I‚Äôm sure this result will set us up well for the future. We have good, young players and now we must wait for 2026.‚Äù The wait for World Cup number 23 will be nothing compared to Africa‚Äôs wait for victory over Brazil. Thirty-six years of hurt came to an end on 2 December 2022. The Indomitable Lions finally conquered the indomitable."

Diego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach C√©sar Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes, who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals. The Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later. The closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time.

The match was played in front of a record attendance of 114,600 people.

Despite not having a shot until after the 80th minute, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area. Mbapp√© scored the penalty, and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores. With the scores tied, the match went to extra time. Messi scored again for Argentina in the second extra time half. Mbapp√© was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after his initial shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel.

Head coaches[edit] Through Argentinian team history, several coaches had trained it with different football styles from offensive to defensive tactics. There are two predominant 'football schools' about world champions coaches C√©sar Menotti who propagates possession and well-look play and Carlos Bilardo who prioritize results and tactical order. These head coaches divides Argentine fans kindly. Other managers such as Marcelo Bielsa has got his own football style.

Against conferences[edit] FIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America. Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian (OFC) squad.

Miscellaneous[edit] Argentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malm√∂. Germany won 3‚Äì1. In the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata's local club Kimberley. France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3‚Äì1. The stadium Jos√© Mar√≠a Minella is the southernmost World Cup venue located at 38¬∞0‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥S 57¬∞33‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥W / 38.00000¬∞S 57.55000¬∞W. Including France vs. Hungary, several matches of the 1978 World Cup were played in this stadium. Mar del Plata is in the south of Buenos Aires Province. In addition, Argentina played against Nigeria at Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg in 2018 making it the northernmost game along other six matches. The Russian city is at 59¬∞58‚Ä≤22.63‚Ä≥N 30¬∞13‚Ä≤13.92‚Ä≥E / 59.9729528¬∞N 30.2205333¬∞E. Referees[edit] As a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy, where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, N√©stor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia. They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament.

Read the team guide here. Star player Mois√©s Caicedo Strengths Ecuador have a very young team and with that comes speed, energy and adrenaline, with several new talents hoping to make their mark. Weaknesses Goalscoring. La Tricolor do not concede a lot but on the other hand they don‚Äôt find the net that often themselves either. Netherlands Jump to another team The Dutch arrive in decent shape with Van Gaal set to become the most successful Oranje coach ever win-wise. Read the team guide here. Star player Virgil van Dijk Strengths The switch to 5-3-2 seems to have worked well, although some players were initially against it, and the form is good, as the Nations League showed. Weaknesses Creativity wise they are dependent on De Jong and Depay, both of whom who have suffered from injuries this season. Qatar Jump to another team A historic first World Cup beckons for the hosts but they are in a tough group with Senegal, Netherlands and Ecuador. Read the team guide here. Strengths Familiarity. Coach S√°nchez has been in charge since 2017 and key members of the team have emerged together from the Aspire Academy. Weaknesses Physically this is a team that has been outmuscled on a number of occasions. How they cope off the ball will be crucial. Senegal Jump to another team The reigning Afcon champions have great ambitions for the World Cup to end an already good year on a high. Read the team guide here. Star player Kalidou Koulibaly Strengths Ciss√© has created a hard-working team and maybe Dia can shoulder some of the responsibility up front with Man√© injured. Weaknesses Quite a few players have struggled with injuries and/or being out of their club sides and arrive lacking playing time. England Jump to another team Semi-finalists in 2018 ‚Äì and Euro finalists three years later ‚Äì Southgate‚Äôs side aim to go all the way ‚Äì but have they peaked? Read the team guide here. Strengths In Kane England have one of the most lethal goalscorers around and he is backed up by creative, young talent such as Foden and Saka. Weaknesses Southgate has been criticised for being overly cautious and there are real concerns about the defence because of injuries and poor form. Iran Jump to another team This will be Iran‚Äôs sixth World Cup and, boosted by a good performance in Russia, their aim is to get out of the group. Read the team guide here. Strengths The reappointment of Carlos Queiroz means that Team Melli are very unlikely to concede any soft goals. He offers defensive stability. Weaknesses The handling of the former coach, Skocic, divided senior players and those feelings could resurface should Iran get off to a bad start. United States Jump to another team USA are back at the World Cup after missing out on Russia but qualifying was anything but plain sailing. Read the team guide here. Star player Christian Pulisic Strengths Coach Berhalter has injected youth into the squad and the press can be effective, while there is creativity up front with Pulisic, Reyna and Aaronson. Weaknesses Centre-back and centre-forward positions are problematic and frequent injuries have prevented Berhalter from playing his best XI. Wales Jump to another team Wales arrive for their first World Cup in 64 years free of expectation but are determined to do more than merely make up the numbers. Read the team guide here. Strengths A band of brothers spirit underpins a modest squad decorated with a pair of game-changers in Bale and Ramsey. Weaknesses If Joe Allen is not fit, they could lack nous in midfield. They also have only one bona fide No 9 in the squad in Moore Argentina Jump to another team Argentina arrive in Qatar in unashamedly good shape having gone 35 games undefeated. Read the team guide here. Strengths Scaloni has created a team and made Messi smile while playing for his country again. That may take them far. Weaknesses Losing Lo Celso to injury is a blow ‚Äì he is an important player for Argentina ‚Äì and Romero‚Äôs hamstring problems are a worry too. Mexico Jump to another team El Tri have reached the Last 16 in every tournament since 1994 but that record feels under threat now. Read the team guide here. Star player Hirving Lozano Strengths Mexico should be able to cause opponents real problems on the wings with Vega and Lozano both dangerous and hard-working. Weaknesses Psychologically they seem to fall apart as soon as they concede and can be really inconsistent in games. Poland Jump to another team Having qualified Poland have a new target: reaching the knockout round for the first time in 40 years. Read the team guide here. Star player Robert Lewandowski Strengths Firepower. In Lewandowski Poland have one of the best strikers in the world, with other players capable of scoring too. Weaknesses Defensive consistency. This has been lost since Euro 2016 and Poland can concede a lot of goals. Saudi Arabia Jump to another team Renard‚Äôs new generation dominated Asian qualifying, but face a tough ask to repeat the achievements of 1994‚Äôs groundbreaking squad. Read the team guide here. Star player Salem Al-Dawsari Strengths They boast the Middle East‚Äôs finest player in Al Dawsari, plus a welcome blend of experience and youth. Conceded only 10 goals in 18 qualifiers. Weaknesses Goals have dried up and there is no clear favourite to start up top. Expected No 1 Al Owais is short of match practice. Australia Jump to another team Australia have had their hopes of progression from a tough group further tempered by a spate of injuries. Read the team guide here. Strengths The Socceroos are more than the sum of their parts and, cringeworthy as it may sound, have a collective mentality built to exceed expectations. Weaknesses A dearth of problem-solving skills against hard-to-break-down opposition is problematic, as is midfield possession and defensive mobility. Denmark Jump to another team Having reached the semi-finals at the Euros and beaten France twice in the Nations League, Denmark arrive high on confidence. Read the team guide here. Star player Christian Eriksen Strengths Denmark are a well organised team, defending well as a unit and able to change formation and tactics during the game. Weaknesses Some of the forwards are out of form and goals could be a problem. A lot, as always, will depend on Eriksen. France Jump to another team Fourth in the world rankings, this is a squad in flux, not unlike the one that showed promise in 2014. Read the team guide here. Strengths France‚Äôs attack is their strong point ‚Äì they have shown themselves capable of scoring nearly at will with a full complement of players. Weaknesses Defence: injuries and a loss of form have decimated France‚Äôs back line. Pogba and Kant√© will be missed in midfield too. Tunisia Jump to another team Tunisia have lost only once since January but the 5-1 defeat against Brazil showed how far up it is to the top sides. Read the team guide here. Star player Youssef Msakni Strengths The midfield is the team‚Äôs strongest area with Ferencvaros‚Äô La√Ødouni capable of running the show against most opponents. Weaknesses Against better teams they struggle to create chances and are a bit too reliant on 32-year-old captain Msakni. Costa Rica Jump to another team Coach Su√°rez only arrived in the middle of 2021 but has completely revamped the squad. Read the team guide here. Strengths The youngsters, such as 18-year-old Bennette, has had a really positive impact while there is stability in defence. Weaknesses This Costa Rica team does not score a lot of goals (13 in 14 qualifiers) and at one point Su√°rez tested too many players. Germany Jump to another team Germany may be one of the giants of world football but they are having a wobble. Semi-finals still a minimum requirement though. Read the team guide here. Strengths There are so many good creative midfielders that someone such as G√ºndogan may not start. San√© and Gnabry offer real threat from the flanks. Weaknesses The midfield is vulnerable defensively and there is no world-class central striker. Also, the quality of the full-backs are not at the highest level. Japan Jump to another team Moriyasu has overhauled the squad and brought through a new generation with such little fuss that the public do not give him enough credit. Read the team guide here. Strengths With Tomiyasu and Yoshida at the back, plus Endo and Morita anchoring the midfield, this is arguably Japan‚Äôs strongest defensive foundation ever. Weaknesses Moriyasu gets criticised whomever he picks among the many attacking options but Japan do have an issue finding the right fit at No 9. Spain Jump to another team ‚ÄòWe go for the win from the first minute,‚Äô says Luis Enrique and Spain expect to go far as always. Read the team guide here. Strengths Gavi and Pedro offer exuberance and energy in midfield and have a certain Busquets by their side to protect them (and the defence). Weaknesses Goals are not always that easy to come by and Morata was heavily criticised by fans at the Euros. He is still Spain‚Äôs focal point. Belgium Jump to another team There is the sense that this generation of players have peaked and that the bronze from four years ago is as good as it will get. Read the team guide here. Star player Kevin De Bruyne Strengths There is an abundance of talent in the squad and any team with Courtois and De Bruyne will be expected to go deep into the tournament. Weaknesses The defence is ageing and slow and the main goal threat, Lukaku, has been struggling with injuries this season. Canada Jump to another team Back on the biggest stage after a 36-year absence they were the best team in Concacaf qualifying, finishing above Mexico and USA. Read the team guide here. Star player Alphonso Davies Strengths Players such as Davies, David and Buchanan offer speed and explosiveness in transition. The team spirit is superb too. Weaknesses Canada lack experience at this level and do not have the star power in defence they have in other outfield areas. Croatia Jump to another team Reached the final four years ago and have the potential to play even better this time. It is a new team but with the same midfield core. Read the team guide here. Strengths The classy midfield can dictate games and the new defence looks good. Croatia have a remarkably deep and versatile squad. Weaknesses The goalkeepers are unreliable; the defenders inexperienced and there is no established goal-scoring presence up front. Morocco Jump to another team A second consecutive Word Cup for the Atlas Lions, they qualified for Qatar without many of the mainstays from four years ago. Read the team guide here. Strengths There is stardust in Hakimi and Ziyech in a hard-working squad with Amrabat offering balance in midfield. Weaknesses Coach Regragui has been accused of playing defensive football in the past and has only been able to work with the squad for two and a half months. Brazil Jump to another team One of the favourites, they are ranked the best team in the world and there seems to be harmony in the squad. Read the team guide here. Strengths Brazil still have Neymar but are no longer Neymar-dependant with Vini Jnr, Richarlison and Raphinha taking some weight off the No 10‚Äôs shoulders. Weaknesses Tite has said he may play five attacking players, which would leave Casemiro vulnerable, and the defence is not the quickest. Cameroon Jump to another team There is a lack of stars in Cameroon‚Äôs squad but that may not be a bad thing. Read the team guide here. Star player Andr√©-Frank Zambo Anguissa Strengths The squad has an impressive mental strength and the FA has worked hard to add players of dual nationality, such as Mbeumo. Weaknesses The coaching staff and players have only worked with each other for eight months and form has been patchy. Serbia Jump to another team Every tournament is the same in Serbia: expectations that do not match the reality. However, there may be ground for optimism this time. Read the team guide here. Star player Dusan Vlahovic Strengths All the attacking players are on the rise and full of confidence. There are no egos and coach Stojkovic gives them freedom to play. Weaknesses The defence does not instil a lot of confidence in Serbian fans and one single mistake can lead to a full-blown collapse. Switzerland Jump to another team Yakin has been able to build on Petkovic‚Äôs foundation and they stayed in the Nations League top group despite a poor start. Read the team guide here. Strengths The generation that won the Under-17 World Cup in 2009 are in their peak years and players such as Akanji and Embolo are in fine form. Weaknesses Three of the four goalkeepers have had injury problems and the decision to take only two recognised full-backs could backfire. Ghana Jump to another team This is a young Black Stars team in transition. The quality is there but this World Cup could be either a spectacular failure or a rip-roaring success. Read the team guide here. Star player Mohammed Kudus Strengths Ghana outsmarted Nigeria in the play-off and have added players of dual nationality since then, especially in defence and on the wings, and look better for it. Weaknesses Where will the goals come from? That is the main question for coach Addo. If that is answered, Ghana could go far in Qatar. Portugal Jump to another team Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs power is on the wane and Fernando Santos has lost some of the credit gained in 2016 but Portugal have never had a stronger squad. Read the team guide here. Star player Cristiano Ronaldo Strengths Portugal have excellent goalkeepers, some of the best full-backs in the world and quality solutions all over midfield. Oh, and firepower up front. Weaknesses Santos does not have an abundance of centre-backs and up front Ronaldo‚Äôs struggles and Jota‚Äôs injury have cast a cloud over the preparations. South Korea Jump to another team Things were looking good for manager Bento, until Son broke his eye socket. He could still play though. Read the team guide here. Strengths Bento‚Äôs 4-1-4-1 system worked well in qualifying with a 2-0 win against Iran the highlight. Weaknesses Son‚Äôs injury the major concern but several key players, such as the two Hwangs and Kwon, have been out of form. Uruguay Jump to another team Uruguay are an unknown quantity but Diego Alonso has a good mix of youth and experience in the squad. Read the team guide here. Star player Federico Valverde Strengths Alonso has one of the best midfields at the tournament, led by Valverde, while N√∫√±ez, Su√°rez and Cavani are a threat up front. Weaknesses There are huge question marks about the defence with the fitness of God√≠n, Gim√©nez and Araujo uncertain."

34,sport football article 11494503 Japan break record lowest possession recorded winning World Cup 1966,"REVEALED: Japan's 18 per cent possession in their shock 2-1 win over Spain is the LOWEST a winning team has recorded in a World Cup match since 1966... after they also beat Germany with just 27 per cent of the ball! - Hajime Moriyasu's side defeated Spain - and Germany - to advance to knockouts - Beat the two giants of world football to finish top of Group E against the odds - Germany eliminated from the World Cup as a result of Japan's victory - Recorded the third lowest victorious possession total in win over Germany - Japan will face Croatia in the last-16 bidding for a place in the quarter-finals - Follow Sportsmail's daily World Cup live blog for all updates from Qatar - Click here for the latest World Cup 2022 news, fixtures, live action and results Japan shocked all in beating Germany and Spain to reach the last-16 of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - and the stats have laid bare the remarkable nature of their achievement. Hajime Moriyasu's side upset the odds in beating the two football giants - with five World Cups between them - to finish top of Group E and set up a seemingly winnable last-16 tie with Croatia. Key to their success was their ability to sit deep, made viable by their impressive backline, and hit the over-exposed sides on the break. Japan were forced - as they did against Germany - to sit in for large periods and contain Spain enjoyed lots of the ball and could have wrapped the game up by the break but Japan rode their luck and emerged victorious Indeed, such was the players' ability to carry out their coach's instructions, Japan broke the record for the lowest amount of possession held by a winning team in any World Cup fixture since 1966. Their 18 per cent possession of Spain outstripped South Korea's 26 per cent against Germany in 2018 and their own 27 per cent against the same opposition in their Group E opener. Forced to sit back and contain Spain for much of the first half, Japan trailed at the break thanks to a header from Alvaro Morata, notching his third goal in three games - seemingly ensuring his side finished top of the group. The Japan players ensured they carried out coach Hajime Moriyasu's instructions to a tee The Japan players fell to the ground and celebrated wildly after they beat Spain to finish top of Group E However, coming out for the second half, Moriyasu made his - now - customary changes and Japan emerged out of their shell to leave Spain's players dumbfounded and fearful of their place in the next round. Ritsu Doan, introduced at half-time alongside Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, got Japan level just after the break with a lashed left-footed effort that was too powerful for Unai Simon in the Spain goal. With their tails up and knowing Germany were likely to defeat Costa Rica, Japan pressed for another, three minutes after their equaliser they had it through Ao Tanaka . The controversy surrounding their second - was the ball over the line or wasn't it - took away from the astonishing nature of their achievement. Their policy of containment allowed them to hit an over-exposed Spain side on the break Needing to protect their lead, Japan retreated back into their customary low block with Shogo Taniguchi, Maya Yoshida and Kou Itakura being joined by Arsenal's Takehiro Tomiyasu to form a solid base which Spain, for all their possession, could not penetrate. Japan's 27 per cent of the ball against Germany had seemed impressive, but sinking to 18 per cent has left many wondering how low can Japan go with their low block in attempting to keep their opponents at bay. Spain, meanwhile, were on the receiving end of another shock result that stemmed from a team in essence refusing to hold onto the ball when Switzerland beat them 1-0 at the start of the 2010 World Cup. Ottmar Hitzfeld's side enjoyed just 27.12 per cent of the ball that day. Saudi Arabia's famous victory over Argentina in Qatar last month completes the five lowest totals, with Herve Renard's side recording just 31 per cent possession. Ritsu Doan changed the game off the bench for Japan as they stunned Spain to go through to the last-16 as Group E winners No comments have so far been submitted.

Key Facts Pepe, who will turn 40 in February, scored with a header off a corner kick in the first of half of the match, bringing the score to 2-0 at halftime. Meanwhile, England‚Äôs 19-year-old Jude Bellingham became the first player born in the 21st century to score a goal in a World Cup match, during his team‚Äôs group stage match against Iran. The Qatar tournament also features the first set of full siblings to compete for different teams, with I√±aki Williams representing Ghana and his younger brother, Nico Williams, making his World Cup debut for Spain (the Williams brothers were born in Spain to a Ghanaian father and Liberian mother, and I√±aki previously played for Spain).

When Qatar lost to Ecuador earlier this month, it was the first time in World Cup history that a host team lost its opening match. Key Background The Qatar World Cup is the first ever held in the Middle East, and the most expensive in the tournament‚Äôs history, with Qatar spending an estimated $220 billion over the past decade to prepare, including constructing seven new stadiums in which to hold matches. Because of the hot Qatari climate, the tournament is also the first to be held in winter instead of the usual summer schedule, which has disrupted club lineups in other countries. FIFA‚Äôs decision to hold the World Cup in Qatar has drawn controversy due to the country‚Äôs human rights record, and after scores of migrant workers died while working on World Cup-related construction projects. Qatar and FIFA officials have also been accused of bribery and corruption in voting to hold the tournament in the country.

Victory sets up a last-16 clash with Group A runners-up Senegal on Sunday for England, while Wales crashed out in Qatar without a win for the first time in a major tournament. Foden started at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium after being left out of the goalless draw with the United States on Friday and won the free-kick for Rashford to break the deadlock in the 50th minute. Manchester City star Foden extended the lead just a minute later before Rashford doubled his account to eliminate an uninspiring Wales from Group B, in which the USA beat Iran to progress as runners-up. 3 ‚Äì Marcus Rashford is the first Manchester United player to score three goals at a major tournament for England since Bobby Charlton at the 1966 World Cup.

England continued to dominate possession without testing Ward often as Foden blasted over on the turn, while Joe Allen angled a rare Wales chance off target before the break. A masterful Foden drive ended with an England free-kick in an inviting position before Rashford whipped into the top-right corner to beat an unsighted Ward. Harry Kane drilled across the area from the right soon after for Foden to convert at the back post, before Jordan Pickford parried from Kieffer Moore to keep Wales at bay. Ward was again beaten with somewhat ease as Rashford powered through the legs of the goalkeeper, who denied Jude Bellingham to keep the scoreline down late on. What does it mean? England continue Wales dominance to book last-16 berth The pressure ramped upon England after an underwhelming showing in the USA stalemate but Southgate's side responded well in their first World Cup meeting with a fellow British side. England remained patient throughout and reaped well-deserved rewards in a rapid second-half opening to ensure a seventh straight victory over Wales, scoring 14 and conceding just one in that run. Knockout football is where England have impressed in recent years and Southgate will know it is time to deliver again, while Wales head home after disappointing in just their second appearance in the tournament. Rashford redemption Rashford will have been frustrated to chip a presentable opening at the incoming Ward in what proved to be England's best first-half chance. But the forward made amends after the interval with two goals, while recording game-leading figures for touches in the opposition box (eight), shots (six) and attempts on target (four) in an encouraging showing. Bale missing on the world stage Gareth Bale had the fewest touches of any Wales players to complete 90 minutes in both games against the USA and Iran, though a penalty in the first outing somewhat sheltered the Wales captain from criticism.

40,en news oldest goal scorer fifa world cup football,"Roger Milla holds the record of being the oldest footballer to score a goal in the FIFA World Cup, having scored at the age of 42 years and 39 days. Know the full list. Football, especially at the highest levels like the FIFA World Cup, is a young man‚Äôs game. Outfield players in football peak in their late 20s or early 30s. By the time they are in their mid-30s, most are past their prime and consequently, players over 35 are often a rarity on the biggest stage of the game However, there are an exceptional few, who have defied age and made their mark on the biggest of stages even in their twilight years. Cameroon legend Roger Milla, the oldest goal-scorer in a FIFA World Cup match, and Portugal ace Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently became the third-oldest footballer to score in a World Cup match, are fine examples. Here are the 10 oldest World Cup goal-scorers in the history of football. No. Player (Country) Age Opponent Edition  1 Roger Milla (Cameroon) 42 years, 39 days Russia USA 1994  2 Pepe (Portugal) 39 years, 283 days Switzerland Qatar 2022  3 Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) 37 years, 295 days Ghana Qatar 2022  4 Gunnar Gren (Sweden) 37 years, 236 day West Germany Sweden 1958  5 Cuauhtemoc Blanco (Mexico) 37 years, 151 days France South Africa 2010  6 Felipe Baloy (Panama) 37 years, 120 days England Russia 2018  7 Obdulio Varela (Uruguay) 36 years, 279 days England Switzerland 1954  8 Martin Palermo (Argentina) 36 years, 227 days Greece South Africa 2010  9 Georges Bregy (Switzerland) 36 years, 152 days USA USA 1994  10 Tom Finney (England) 36 years, 64 days Soviet Union Sweden 1958 Cameroon legend Roger Milla holds the record of being the oldest footballer to score a goal in the men‚Äôs FIFA World Cup, having netted against Russia in the 1994 World Cup in the USA at the ripe old age of 42 years and 39 days. To date, Roger Milla, often dubbed ‚Äòthe Old Lion‚Äô by fans, is the only player over 40 years of age to have scored at a World Cup. However, perhaps the story that led up to Milla‚Äôs feat is even more fascinating than the record in itself. Having made his international debut in 1973, Roger Milla retired from international football in 1987 at the age of 35. For 15 years, the striker had enjoyed a fruitful career with the national side and hung up his boots with the reputation as one of the best footballers to have ever come out of Cameroon and Africa. An Olympian from the Los Angeles 1984 Games, Roger Milla had also represented Cameroon at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain and even got the ball in the net in a match against Peru. Unfortunately, the goal was disallowed and Milla had made peace with the fact that his dream of scoring in a World Cup will remain unrealised. However, little did Milla know when he retired that his best years were yet to come. The striker was still playing club football after his early international retirement. However, after Cameroon qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, fate came calling. Paul Biya, the then President of Cameroon, had seen Milla play in a charity match and insisted that he be included in the national team for the showpiece in Italy. Biya went a step further and personally called Roger Milla to make up his mind. ‚ÄúI got a call from the President who said he thought I should play and I was in no position to argue. I knew that if I got into shape, I could make an impact.‚Äù Milla later told Reuters. Roger Milla scored four goals, all after coming on as a substitute, to lead Cameroon to the quarter-finals of Italy 1990 - the furthest any African team had progressed in the competition at that time. Senegal matched the record in 2002. Milla didn‚Äôt score in his nine-minute cameo against reigning champions Argentina, a match Cameroon famously won with nine men. But Milla scored twice against Romania in a group game before single-handedly dragging the Indomitable Lions to the quarters with a brace against Colombia in the Round of 16. Incidentally, any of Milla‚Äôs goals in the 1990 World Cup would have been enough to make him the oldest-ever scorer in FIFA World Cup history. His extra-time brace against Colombia in the pre-quarterfinals came when he was 38 years and 34 days old - a good 100 days younger than Cristiano Ronaldo, the second-oldest World Cup scorer in history. However, Roger Milla would return for the 1994 World Cup in the USA and scored Cameroon‚Äôs only goal in a 6-1 defeat to Russia. However, his feat in the contest was overshadowed by Oleg Salenko‚Äôs five goals, which still stands as the record for most goals scored in a single World Cup match by a player. Roger Milla is also the oldest outfield player and third-oldest player to have ever taken the field in a football World Cup match. Egypt‚Äôs Essam El-Hadary (45 years, 161 days) and Colombia‚Äôs Faryd Mondragon (43 years, 3 days), the top two oldest players to have played in a World Cup match, were both goalkeepers. Pepe became the oldest player to score at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar when he netted one in Portugal‚Äôs 6-1 drubbing of Switzerland in the Round of 16. At 39 years and 283 days, Pepe thus became the second-oldest ever to score at the World Cup, eclipsing Cristiano Ronaldo, who had taken the position in the team‚Äôs opening game. Captaining the team against Switzerland, Pepe was the second player to score in the match, handing Portugal a 2-0 lead in the 33rd minute. In the end, however, it was Gon√ßalo Ramos who starred for Portugal with a hat-trick, the first of Qatar 2022. Cristiano Ronaldo became the third-oldest World Cup goal-scorer in history after converting from the penalty spot during Portugal‚Äôs 3-2 win over Ghana in their Group H opener at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. The Portuguese legend‚Äôs penalty kick in the 65th minute was the opening goal of the match and proved vital as the match ended 3-2 in Portugal‚Äôs favour. Incidentally, Russian defender Sergei Ignashevich did score an own goal against Spain in the 2018 World Cup in South Africa at the age of 38 years and 352 days. However, self goals aren‚Äôt counted as records. Before Roger Milla came out of retirement and scored his maiden World Cup goal against Romania in Italy 1990, Sweden‚Äôs Gunnar Gren owned the record of the oldest goal-scorer in a football World Cup for over three decades. Gunnar Gren‚Äôs only World Cup goal came against West Germany in the semi-finals, a match Sweden famously won before going down 5-2 to Pele‚Äôs Brazil in the final. Gunnar Gren‚Äôs Swedish team-mate Nils Liedholm netted the opening goal in the 1958 final against Brazil, which made him the oldest player to score in a World Cup final. Nils Liedholm was 35 years and 264 days old at the time. Considered one of the greats of Swedish football, Gunnar Gren played a pivotal role in helping his national team win the gold medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Obdulio Varela, who captained Uruguay to the FIFA World Cup title in 1950, and Germany‚Äôs Miroslav Klose, the top goal-scorer in World Cup history also features in the top 10 list of oldest scorers in the football World Cup. Formiga (Brazil) 37 years and 98 days vs South Korea in FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup 2015 Brazil‚Äôs Formiga is the oldest goal-scorer in the FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup, having scored in a match against South Korea in her team‚Äôs Group E opener vs South Africa in the FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup 2015 in Canada. She was 37 years and 98 days old at the time. USA legend Megan Rapinoe is the oldest player to have scored in a FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup final. She scored in the 2019 Women‚Äôs World Cup final against the Netherlands just two days after her 34th birthday."
41,en in news what happened confederations cup world cup warm up cancelled bltc39f7dc2393dfcc8,"Once upon a time, not all that long ago, players and supporters would be given a taste of what was to come at an upcoming World Cup finals when the Confederations Cup was staged 12 months prior to FIFA‚Äôs flagship event. The competition - which started out in Saudi Arabia as the King Fahd Cup - was originally introduced on a biennial basis between 1992 and 2001, before being moved to the World Cup hosts as it eventually became an event which took place every four years. Why does it no longer form part of the footballing calendar, who can claim to have collected the crown and could it be brought back in the future? GOAL takes a look at all of those questions... What happened to the Confederations Cup? In 2019, it was confirmed by FIFA that the Confederations Cup would be consigned to the history books. The tournament had featured the holders of the World Cup and the continental champions from across the six FIFA regions ‚Äì AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA. The competition was last staged in 2017, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with a revision to the international calendar made prior to Qatar 2022. FIFA took the decision to do away with the Confederations Cup as they instead look to expand the Club World Cup. That event is set to feature 24 teams heading forward, although the new format had to be shelved in 2021 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the need to reschedule Euro 2020 and the Copa America. Some may consider it a good thing that the Confederations Cup is no longer up for grabs as no side that collected the trophy went on to savour ultimate glory at the following World Cup finals. Confederations Cup history: Winners, finals and hosts The competition became known as the FIFA Confederations Cup in 1997, but continued to be held in the Middle East at that point. Brazil are the most successful side in the competition's history, claiming top prize on four occasions - including a run of three successive triumphs between 2005 and 2013. Year Hosts Final 1992 Saudi Arabia Argentina 3-1 Saudi Arabia 1995 Saudi Arabia Denmark 2-0 Argentina 1997 Saudi Arabia Brazil 6-0 Australia 1999 Mexico Mexico 4-3 Brazil 2001 South Korea/Japan France 1-0 Japan 2003 France France 1-0 Cameroon (aet) 2005 Germany Brazil 4-1 Argentina 2009 South Africa Brazil 3-2 United States 2013 Brazil Brazil 3-0 Spain 2017 Russia Germany 1-0 Chile Could the Confederations Cup be revived?Getty While FIFA are eager to implement grander club competitions, there has been plenty of discussion regarding more frequent international events. Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who is now FIFA‚Äôs chief of global football development, attracted criticism for suggesting that the World Cup could be staged every two years. While that proposal appears to be off the table for now, a revival of the Confederations Cup ‚Äì or something similar ‚Äì could be looked into by world football‚Äôs governing body. FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani told Reuters in December 2021: ‚ÄúThe principle of having an event, in between World Cups, is something I am totally for. ‚ÄúThe question is what is that going to be, how do we look at it, how does that affect other things like qualification processes and tournaments that are already there? That is the process that we need to go through.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe used to have something in between the World Cups, which was the old Confederations Cup. ‚ÄúIt wasn't a tournament that everyone was turned on to but for some confederations it was a nice link between your regional competition and an international competition and we lost that. ‚ÄúFour or five years ago we had discussions over a 'Global Nations League‚Äô so these discussions are not foreign to the table. ‚ÄúThey might look different, whether it is a Global Nations League, a Confederations Cup or Arsene's idea of a biennial World Cup, these are events that occur in between the current World Cup cycles.‚Äù"

In Short - 23-year-old Kylian Mbappe scored 2 stunning goals in the FIFA World Cup Final - Mbappe turned the game on his head singlehandedly By India Today Web Desk: Kylian Mbappe pipped Lionel Messi in an epic finish to the Golden Boot race in the final of the FIFA World Cup 2022. Messi and Mbappe came into the final of the FIFA World Cup with 5 goals each but Messi was the one to take a lead after converting his penalty in the first half. Things seemed lost for France late in the second half when they were trailing 2-0 against Argentina and had not taken a single shot till the 70th minute of the game. However, Mbappe had other ideas a produced a tremendous burst of two minutes scoring 2 goals to turn the game on its head. Mbappe goals stunned Argentina who looked devastated after losing the grip of the game. Mbappe kept becoming more threatening as the game progressed in the final minutes of the game and kept the Argentine defence on its toes with his pace. Mbappe pipped Lionel Messi's 7 goals in the tournament, and scored 8 of his own, with 2 goals coming from penalties. At regulation time, Mbappe was ahead of Messi but the Argentine captain drew level in the dying moments of extra time, tapping in a rebound from Hugo Lloris. Messi now holds the record of scoring at least one goal in all the knockout matches of the FIFA World Cup, has scored 4 goals from penalties. The Argentine captain was once again taken over by Mbappe in the extra time, when Montiel conceded a penalty in the 118th minute of the game. Mbappe converted his final shot on goal and finished the tournament with 8 goals, and straight out beat Messi in the number of goals. This meant that Mbappe, at just 23, is now a Golden Boot winner at the FIFA World Cup, and has the most number of finals goals in the FIFA World Cup."

Parallel tournaments were organised by FIFA's six confederations. Qualification started on 6 June 2019 with several matches of the AFC zone, the first being between Mongolia and Brunei, and ended on 14 June 2022 with an inter-confederation play-off between Costa Rica and New Zealand.[note 4] Mongolian player Norjmoogiin Tsedenbal netted the first goal, while the last one was scored by Joel Campbell of Costa Rica. In contrast to previous editions, there was no general preliminary draw, with confederations carrying out separate draws due to their differing timelines.[better source needed] The qualification process suffered numerous postponements from March 2020 onwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, FIFA considers Serbia as the successor team of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro, who between them qualified on 10 occasions. Qualification process[edit] All FIFA member associations, of which there are currently 211, were eligible to enter qualification. Qatar, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, Qatar was obliged by the AFC to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also acted as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar won their group so the fifth-best group runners-up advanced to the AFC third round instead. For the first time after the initial two tournaments of 1930 and 1934, the World Cup will be hosted by a country whose national team has never played a finals match before. The reigning World Cup champions France also participated in qualifying as normal. The allocation of slots for each confederation was discussed by the FIFA Executive Committee on 30 May 2015 in Z√ºrich after the FIFA Congress. The committee decided that the same allocation used in 2006, 2010, and 2014 would be kept for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments: - AFC (Asia): 4 or 5 - CAF (Africa): 5 - CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean): 3 or 4 - CONMEBOL (South America): 4 or 5 - OFC (Oceania): 0 or 1 - UEFA (Europe): 13 - Hosts: 1 Summary of qualification[edit] Confederation Available slots in finals Teams started Teams eliminated Teams qualified Qualifying start date Qualifying end date  AFC 4+1 or 5+1 45+1 40 5+1 6 June 2019 13 June 2022  CAF 5 54 49 5 4 September 2019 29 March 2022  CONCACAF 3 or 4 34 30 4 24 March 2021 14 June 2022  CONMEBOL 4 or 5 10 6 4 8 October 2020 13 June 2022  OFC 0 or 1 7 7 0 17 March 2022 14 June 2022  UEFA 13 55 42 13 24 March 2021 5 June 2022  Total 31+1 205+1 174 31+1 6 June 2019 14 June 2022 Withdrew or suspended[edit] North Korea withdrew from the AFC second qualifying round for safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other smaller island states likewise retracted their participation during the World Cup qualification: Saint Lucia, American Samoa, Samoa, Vanuatu and Cook Islands, while Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga‚ÄìHunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami. On 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major international sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators. However, the Russia national team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applies to the World Cup proper as a world championship. The WADA ruling allowed athletes who were not involved in doping or the coverup to compete, but prohibited the use of the Russian flag and anthem at major international sporting events. An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was filed, but WADA's decision was upheld though reduced to a two-year ban. The CAS ruling also allowed the name ""Russia"" to be displayed on uniforms if the words ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team"" have equal prominence. If Russia had qualified for the tournament, its players would not have been able to use their country's name alone, flag or anthem at the World Cup, as a result of the nation's two-year ban from world championships and Olympic Games in all sports. On 27 February 2022, after the threat of boycotts by the Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA prohibited the Russia national football team from playing home matches in Russia; the team would have to play matches behind closed doors at neutral sites. In addition, the team would have been prohibited from competing under the name, flag, or national anthem of Russia, and had to compete under the name ""Football Union of Russia"" (RFU). On 28 February, however, in accordance with a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia. Poland were subsequently given a walkover for their play-off semi-final match scheduled against Russia. The Russian Football Union announced they would appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Their request for a temporary lift of the ban was rejected on 18 March. Format[edit] The formats of the qualifying competitions depended on each confederation (see below). Each round might be played in either of the following formats: - League format, in which more than two teams formed groups to play home-and-away round-robin matches, or in exceptions permitted by the FIFA Organising Committee, single round-robin matches hosted by one of the participating teams or on neutral territory. - Knockout format, in which two teams play home-and-away two-legged matches or single-legged matches. Tiebreakers[edit] In league format, the ranking of teams in each group is based on the following criteria (regulations Articles 20.4 and 20.6): - Points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss) - Overall goal difference - Overall goals scored - Points in matches between tied teams - Goal difference in matches between tied teams - Goals scored in matches between tied teams - Away goals scored in matches between tied teams (if the tie is only between two teams in home-and-away league format) - Fair play points - first yellow card: minus 1 point - indirect red card (second yellow card): minus 3 points - direct red card: minus 4 points - yellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points - Drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee In cases when teams finishing in the same position across different groups are compared to determine which teams advance to the next stage, the criteria depend on the competition format and require the approval of FIFA (regulations Article 20.8). In knockout format, the team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round. If aggregate scores finish level, then the away goals rule is applied.[a] The away goals rule is again applied after extra time.[b] If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out (regulations Article 20.10). - ^ The team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time are played, divided into two 15-minute halves - ^ If there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored Confederation qualification[edit] AFC[edit] The opening two rounds of qualifying also served as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Therefore, Qatar, the 2022 FIFA World Cup host, only participated in the first two rounds of qualifying. The qualification structure is as follows: - First round: 12 teams (ranked 35‚Äì46) played home-and-away over two legs. The six winners advanced to the second round. - Second round: 40 teams (ranked 1‚Äì34, including Qatar as the host, and the six winners from the first round) were divided into eight groups of five teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The eight group winners and the four best group runners-up were set to advance to the third round. As Qatar won their group, the fifth-best runner-up advanced in their stead. - Third round: 12 teams that had advanced from the second round were divided into two groups of 6 teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The top two teams of each group qualified for the World Cup, and the two third-placed teams advanced to the fourth round. - Fourth round: One third-placed team in each third round group played against each other in a single match, the winners advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs. Final positions (third round)[edit] Group A Group B     Fourth round[edit] Team 1 Score Team 2  United Arab Emirates 1‚Äì2 Australia CAF[edit] CAF announced on 10 July 2019 a reversion to the format used for its 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification competition. - First round: Twenty-eight teams (ranked 27‚Äì54) played home-and-away over two legs. The fourteen winners advanced to the second round. - Second round: Forty teams (teams ranked 1‚Äì26 and fourteen first-round winners) were divided into ten groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The ten group winners advanced to the third round. - Third round: Ten teams that had advanced from the second round played home-and-away over two legs. The five winners qualified for the World Cup, and no teams advance to the intercontinental playoffs. Third round[edit] Team 1 Agg.

However, on 25 June 2020, following FIFA's decision to postpone the September international window because of the pandemic, CONCACAF noted that ""the challenges presented by postponements to the football calendar, and the incomplete FIFA rankings cycle in our confederation, means our current World Cup qualifying process has been compromised and will be changed."" On 27 July, CONCACAF announced a new qualifying format for the World Cup. - First round: Thirty CONCACAF teams, ranked 6 to 35 based on the FIFA rankings of July 2020, were drawn into six groups of five and played single round-robin matches (two home and two away), the six group winners advanced to the second round. - Second round: Six first round group winners played in a two-legged home-and-away series. The three winners advanced to the third round. - Third round: Eight teams, three second-round winners and the top five CONCACAF teams (Mexico, United States, Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Honduras) also based on those FIFA rankings, played home-and-away round-robin matches in one single group. The top three teams qualified for the World Cup and the fourth-placed team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.

From October 2020 to March 2022 (previously scheduled for March 2020 to November 2021, but later postponed by the pandemic), all ten CONMEBOL teams played in a league of home-and-away round-robin matches. The top four teams qualified for the World Cup and the fifth-placed team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.

Earlier in July that year, the OFC submitted a proposal to FIFA for the qualifiers in response to the pandemic, intending to organise a group stage in March and June 2021 followed by semi-finals and a final in September and October of that year. After continued delays, by September 2021 the OFC felt it was ""not possible at this time to organise a qualifying competition within the Oceania region"" and it was instead staged in Qatar in March 2022. The qualifying stage was to be a single match on 13 March 2022 between the two lowest-ranked participating OFC nations in the FIFA World Rankings, with the winner advancing to the group stage. Then eight remaining teams were drawn into two groups of four, playing single leg round-robin. The top two teams from each group advanced to a single leg knockout stage. The final winner advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.

However, because of the pandemic, the draw was held as a virtual event without any representatives of member associations present. It was originally planned to be held on 29 November. Earlier on 18 June, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the draw regulations for the qualifying group stage. The 55 teams were seeded into six pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of November 2020, after the league phase of the 2020‚Äì21 UEFA Nations League. The qualification format was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland on 4 December 2019. The qualification depends, in part, on results from the 2020‚Äì21 UEFA Nations League, although to a lesser degree than UEFA Euro 2020. The structure maintained UEFA's usual 'group stage/playoff stage' structure, with only the specific format of the play-offs amended. - First round (group stage): Ten groups of either five or six teams with group winners qualifying for the World Cup finals. The four teams in the 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals (France, Belgium, Italy, and Spain) were put into the smaller groups. - Second round (play-off stage): 12 teams (ten group runners-up and the best two Nations League group winners, based on the Nations League overall ranking, that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group) were drawn into three play-off paths, playing two rounds of single-match play-offs (semi-finals with the seeded teams to host, followed by finals, with the home teams to be drawn), with the three path winners qualifying for the World Cup.

Senegal players celebrate a goal scored by teammate Idrissa Gana Gueye, during the World Cup 2022 - Africa playoff soccer match between Senegal and Egypt at at Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade stadium in Dakar, Senegal, Tuesday, March 29, 2022. AP            Sadio Mane, just like he did in last month's Nations Cup final in Cameroon, converted the winning penalty with a powerful shot down the middle to spark jubilant scenes at the new 50,000-seater Abdoulaye Wade Stadium near the capital Dakar.  Related  2022 African World Cup playoffs results & scorers (2nd leg)   Egypt v Senegal: Head-to-head record   RELIVE: Senegal v Egypt (2022 African World Cup qualifying playoff, 2nd leg)  Egypt's spot-kick specialists Mohamed Salah and Ahmed Zizo astonishingly missed the team's first two efforts, failing to capitalize on equally opening misses from Senegal's Kalidou Koulibaly and Saliou Ciss. Another wasted kick from Egypt striker Mostafa Mohamed, who saw his tame shot come off¬†the outstretched legs of Edouard Mendy, condemned the Pharaohs to a cruel loss as they failed to make back-to-back World Cup appearances for the first time. Several Egypt players wept following the final whistle, with Mane upstaging the subdued Salah once again in another eye-catching duel between the Liverpool teammates. In a scenario similar to Egypt's 1-0 first-leg win in Cairo, striker Boulaye Dia bundled home the opener from four yards out early on after a free-kick was met with a half-hearted defensive clearance. A physical game then unfolded, with both sides struggling to string passes together in a first half low on quality. Egypt vastly improved after the break, threatening on several occasions although Senegal's Ismaila Sarr also spurned a glorious chance for the hosts. Senegal were in control in extra time as Egypt were indebted to goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shennawi for denying some near-certain goals, with Mane and Sarr wreaking havoc down both flanks. Early goal After Ciss's early own goal gave Egypt a first-leg advantage on Friday, it was Senegal's turn to also find the net after four minutes as the passionate home fans, who occasionally threw bottles onto the pitch, were in delirium. A free-kick was floated to the far post, where a poor headed clearance by left-back Ahmed Fattouh fell to Villarreal striker Dia to drill home off El-Shennawi from close range. It was then a scrappy and tense affair as too many fouls and some flying tackles disrupted the flow of the game and cost Egypt two substitutions, with central defender Rabia making way for Ahly teammate Ayman Ashraf and right-back Omar Gaber replaced for natural central midfielder Emam Ashour. Egypt's long balls were easily dealt with by Senegal's rearguard, which had a torrid time in the second half nevertheless. A triple substitution paid off as Egypt were reinvigorated, with Zamalek winger Zizo in particular unsettling Senegal's defence with his pace and trickery. Egypt had three chances to sucker-punch Senegal, who were on the back foot for most of the second half. On 51 minutes, Mahmoud Trezeguet was foiled by Chelsea keeper Mendy on the left hand side of the area after a threaded pass from Salah while Zizo could have scored with his first effort after coming on, leaping above his marker and heading just wide following an inswinging cross from Salah on 71 minutes. Zizo threatened again a few minutes later after cutting inside from the left, his low shot narrowly missing the target. But the second half's best chance came at the other end, with Sarr missing a sitter eight minutes from time when he broke clear and beat the offside trap following a defence-splitting pass from Mane, only to drag his shot wide with the goal at his mercy. Senegal then pinned Egypt into their own half in the first half of extra time and could have settled the tie in their favour had it not been for El-Shennawi. The towering Ahly goalie tipped over a header from Pape Abou Cisse and made a superb reflex save to thwart a goal-bound shot from Sarr after Mane had found them unmarked with a couple of inviting crosses. The shootout marked a fitting end, with Salah blasting his effort high over and Mane stealing the show with a composed kick.

46,en news world cup 2022 female referees top facts qatar,"Women referees have been selected to officiate at the FIFA men's World Cup for the first time in history. Here are the top things you need to know about Yamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart. Three referees are making history as they will officiate at the men's football World Cup in Qatar. Stephanie Frappart, Yamashita Yoshimi and Salima Mukansanga are among the 36 referees selected for the tournament. The final is scheduled for December 18. They will also be joined by Neuza Back of Brazil, Mexico's Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt who are headed to the World Cup as three of 69 assistant referees. Here's what you need to know about FIFA's trailblazing officiating trio. The French official is arguably one of the most recognised names listed for the 2022 World Cup. Stephanie Frappart will become the first woman in history to officiate a men's World Cup match when Germany play Costa Rica on Thursday (1 December). She was already the fourth official in Mexico's game with Poland earlier in the tournament. The 38-year-old has a career littered with firsts, and in Qatar she will continue to blaze a trail in her wake. Frappart took the reigns in her first final in 2019 at the World Cup in France, and went on to officiate at the UEFA Super Cup final in the same year. In 2020 she made waves in the refereeing world, writing her name in the history books by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men's Champions League match. A year later, Frappart would lead the way as Atletico Madrid faced Chelsea in a second leg round of 16 tie in the women's UCL. Before being announced as part of the plans for Qatar, she also refereed the 2022 Coupe de France final. Frappart's conduct on the pitch speaks for itself, and has resulted in her winning IFFHS World's Best Woman Referee award three years on the bounce from 2019. The presence of women officials at the men's World Cup will send a ""strong"" message, according to the Frenchwoman. ""It's a strong sign from FIFA and the authorities to have women referees in that country,"" she said, adding her hopes that this decision can ""make things happen"". Japanese referee Yamashita Yomishi will appear at a second consecutive World Cup after officiating the 2019 Women's World Cup in France. She also took charge at the 2020 Olympic Games, held in 2021, in a game between the United States and Sweden. But refereeing in Qatar won't be the only time she has made history this year. Yamashita was on the whistle for Melbourne City's 2-1 win over Jeonnam Dragons in the AFC Champions League, and FC Tokyo's 2-0 win over Kyoto Sanga in the J1 League - becoming the first female referee to do so. The 36-year-old is relishing in the opportunity to be part of history, in spite of the pressures that come with it. ""There are hardly any female referees in the Middle East, so I would like to see that change, with the Qatar World Cup as the catalyst,"" she said. ""The fact that women are officiating for the first time at a men's World Cup is a sign to other people that women's potential is always growing and that is something I also feel strongly about."" Rwandan referee Salima Mukansanga has been officiating for FIFA since 2012. But as a young girl, her dream was to play basketball professionally. ""I liked basketball and wanted to take it very seriously,"" she told New Times. ""But access to basketball infrastructure was hard, that's how I ended up in refereeing, which I have also never regretted."" And that decision has led her to the 2019 Women's World Cup, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, and now Qatar. Much like Yamashita, she also involved in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics last year. Mukansanga is no stranger to the world stage, having also taken charge at the men's Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year. When named as an official for the 2019 WWC, she said: ‚ÄúOfficiating at the World Cup is every referee‚Äôs dream,"" and for the trailblazing Rwandan, the dream continues next month. The trio will be joined by three more female officials as FIFA selects 69 assistant referees for the World Cup. The aforementioned Back, Medina and Nesbitt will all write their names in the tournament's folklore. Each of them have had their different routes into the profession, but will share a unified history-making moment when they officiate in Qatar. Medina began her career in refereeing by pure chance, but believes it is a position that ""makes you fall more and more in love every day [with football]."" USA's Nesbitt started refereeing as a summer job, but up until the 2019 WWC was a professor of chemistry. In 2020, she was named the MLS Assistant Referee of the Year - becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat. ""It has been an absolute honour to have people say that I‚Äôve become a role model for women,"" Nesbitt told FIFA. 37-year-old Back didn't even realise that she had been selected in the 69-name list until she heard it in the press. ""It's very cool, indescribable, it's a moment of joy, of gratitude, and also a little sense of responsibility,"" Back told the media. Despite any outside pressures, all the ground-breaking officials selected for Qatar are relishing the opportunity to represent women referees in what could be a defining moment going forward."

The Argentine star knows that his team has to win the match in order to qualify for the Round of 16. Lionel Messi reignited Argentina's World Cup challenge with a superb goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico. Messi breathed fresh life into Argentina's campaign with his eighth World Cup goal in his fifth appearance in the finals. The 35-year-old maestro, desperate to crown his glittering career by lifting football's greatest prize, rifled home a low shot on 64 minutes to put Argentina en route to victory. Messi's goal meant he tied the late Diego Maradona on eight goals and 21 appearances at the World Cup for Argentina. After he was named in the starting line-up against Poland, Messi now has surpassed Maradona with 22 appearances at the World Cup. In the match against Poland, Enzo Fernandez was rewarded for his World Cup goal against Mexico with his first-ever start for Argentina as manager Lionel Scaloni made four changes to face Poland on Wednesday. The Benfica player replaces Guido Rodriguez in midfield, with Julian Alvarez coming in for Lautaro Martinez up front. The other two changes were in defence, with Nahuel Molina replacing Gonzalo Montiel and Cristian Romero coming back into the side in place of Lisandro Martinez. Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz made one change, with forward Karol Swiderski coming in for Arkadiusz Milik. Argentina need a win to be sure of progressing, while a point would be enough if Mexico and Saudi Arabia draw in the other Group C game. Poland can qualify for the last 16 for the first time since 1986 with a draw. With AFP inputs"

49,2022 11 26 world cup fifa speaks on ronaldos controversial penalty against ghana,"Sport World Cup: FIFA speaks on Ronaldo‚Äôs controversial penalty against Ghana FIFA‚Äôs expert World Cup analysts have said Cristiano Ronaldo performed a stroke of ‚Äúgenius‚Äù to win the penalty for Portugal in their 3-2 win over Ghana at the 2022 World Cup. Ronaldo became the first male footballer to score at five World Cups on Thursday. The 37-year-old converted a controversial penalty after the referee adjudged that he was brought down by Ghana defender Mohammed Salisu. Ghana coach, Otto Addo, claimed it was a ‚Äúspecial gift‚Äù for Portugal after the match. FIFA‚Äôs Technical Study Group (TSG) held a media briefing in Doha, in which they claimed this year‚Äôs World Cup is on track for a record number of awarded penalties. ‚ÄúMaybe the strikers are getting smarter? ‚ÄúIf you look at the penalty that Ronaldo got, people can say what they want about this man, but the smartness and the ingenious thought to just be patient and wait for that split second to touch the ball first before you, and continue my leg so that your contact will hit my leg, that is total genius,‚Äù former Colombia goalkeeper and TSG panel member, Faryd Mondragon, said. A total of nine penalties have been awarded in the first 16 games. At this rate, the World Cup is on track for a record 36 in the entire 64-game tournament."
50,3914522 2022 11 25 world cup red card history,"Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey became the first player sent off in the 2022 World Cup, as his team were eventually beaten 2-0 by Iran on Friday. The Nottingham Forest ‚Äòkeeper becomes the 174th player to be sent off at a World Cup, but only the third goalkeeper, joining Gianluca Pagliuca (Italy vs Norway, 1994) and Itumeleng Khune (South Africa vs Uruguay, 2010). Advertisement The first-ever player to be sent off in a World Cup match was Peru‚Äôs Placido Galindo, against Romania in the 1930 tournament, but Carlos Caszely of Chile was the first player to actually be shown a physical red card when he was sent off against West Germany in 1974. Here is everything you need to know about red cards at the World Cup‚Ä¶ Players with the most red cards Throughout the competition, no player has ever been sent off multiple times in one tournament. However, since 1930, two players have been sent off more than once across multiple competitions. Rigobert Song, the current manager of Cameroon, has been sent off twice in the competition (against Brazil in 1994 and Chile in 1998), as has French icon Zinedine Zidane, who was sent off in the 2006 final against Italy, and less famously against Saudi Arabia in 1998. Teams with the most red cards Throughout the history of the World Cup, 64 nations have seen a player sent off. The countries with the most red cards in the competition are Brazil (11), Argentina (10), Uruguay (nine), Italy (eight) and Cameroon (eight). Despite leading the way when it comes to the number of dismissals, Brazil have not picked up any red cards in the past two tournaments. Rank Country Sendings off 1 Brazil 11 2 Argentina 10 3 Uruguay 9 4= Cameroon 8 4= Italy 8 6 Netherlands 7 7= Mexico 6 7= France 6 7= Portugal 6 10= Germany 5 Hungary 5 Referees who have shown the most red cards Despite only officiating seven World Cup games across three tournaments, Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez issued five World Cup red cards, including two in one game during the 2006 group stage match between Serbia & Montenegro and Ivory Coast (Serbia‚Äôs Albert Nad and Ivory Coast‚Äôs Cyril Domoraud). French official Joel Quiniou has issued five red cards across his World Cup career, having refereed eight games. That included sending off Uruguay‚Äôs Jose Batista in the first minute of their 1986 match against Scotland for a robust challenge on Gordon Strachan. Advertisement However, it is Mexico‚Äôs Arturo Brizio Carter who holds not only the record for the most red cards shown at World Cups (seven), but also for having shown red cards in the most matches (five).

Other final dismissals include Dutchman John Heitinga‚Äôs against Spain in 2010, Marcel Desailly (France vs Brazil) in 1998, and the double sending-off of Argentina‚Äôs Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti against West Germany in 1990. Of the infamous five, only Desailly ended the day with a winner‚Äôs medal. France had led 2-0 when he was sent off in the 68th minute and ended up winning 3-0. Tournaments with the most red cards Germany, 2006 (28) In a way, Zidane‚Äôs headbutt was a fitting end to a tournament that was plagued with indiscipline. This competition saw 21 teams pick up at least one red card, with two matches seeing three red cards, and one seeing four. That quartet of dismissals came during the now infamous Portugal vs Netherlands round-of-16 tie that saw two players sent off from each team (Deco and Costinha for Portugal, Khalid Boulahrouz and Giovanni van Bronckhorst for the Netherlands). Games between Croatia and Australia, and Italy and the USA both saw three red cards. One of England‚Äôs most infamous red cards came in the quarter-finals when a young Wayne Rooney was dismissed for stamping on Portugal‚Äôs Ricardo Carvalho. The referee who showed him the red card ‚Äî Horacio Elizondo of Argentina ‚Äî also later sent off Zidane in the final. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough madness for one year, English referee Graham Poll also made headlines for issuing three yellow cards to Croatia‚Äôs Josip Simunic in the aforementioned match against Australia. Poll failed to realise he had already booked Simunic when he showed him his second yellow card, then booked him a third time a few minutes later and finally showed the red. Advertisement France, 1998 (22) This competition saw 22 red cards shown across 15 teams, with Cameroon and eventual winners France both picking up the most (three). There were three red cards shown in a game once, and two red cards shown in a game four times, the highest across all competitions to date. The game that saw the most red cards was Denmark‚Äôs 1-1 draw with South Africa, where Miklos Molnar and Morten Wieghorst of Denmark, and South Africa‚Äôs Alfred Phiri were all sent off by referee John Toro Rendon of Colombia. The most famous red card in the tournament was probably David Beckham‚Äôs in England‚Äôs last-16 defeat to Argentina. The Manchester United midfielder saw red for kicking out at Argentina‚Äôs Diego Simeone and was made a scapegoat for the defeat by sections of the English press. South Korea & Japan, 2002 (17) In 2002, Portugal and Paraguay were the leading offenders with two red cards apiece, with Mexican official Felipe Ramos Rizo making his presence known by issuing four red cards in just three matches. Four referees sent off more than one player in a game during the tournament. That included two for Portugal (Joao Pinto and Beto) in their controversial group stage defeat to co-hosts South Korea. South Africa, 2010 (17) The first tournament to take place in Africa saw 17 red cards issued across 13 teams, with Algeria, Australia, Brazil, and Uruguay having two red cards apiece. The most famous was Luis Suarez‚Äôs against Ghana, a goal-line handball which denied Ghana what would surely have been a winner in added time at the end of extra time. Ghana missed the resulting penalty and then lost in the shootout, securing Suarez‚Äôs status as one of the most hated men in Ghana. (Top photo: Mark Leech/Offside via Getty Images)"
51,in soccer news fifa rankings world cup teams updated calculated mxphm9f5h9j81ti9rkhvnqhc,"FIFA rankings are a unique way to measure how national teams compare to each other and can prove important when it comes to tournaments like a World Cup. Draws for such events are influenced by rankings, with the best teams separated from facing each other in the group stages. This means nations with lower rankings are often drawn in tougher groups and have an even tougher task to win the overall tournament. FIFA rankings aren't perfect and have come in for criticism in recent years, but they do provide a solid and reliable overview of a side's general consistency and how they'll likely fair come World Cup time. MORE: World Cup prize money reaches new high  Every World Cup kit for Qatar 2022 FIFA rankings for all 32 World Cup teams Brazil entered the 2022 World Cup as the world No.1 and have held top spot since March 31 this year when they replaced Belgium, who themselves were top for nearly four years. Ghana, meanwhile, arrived in Qatar as the lowest-ranked nation with the African side currently 61st. Italy (6th) are the highest ranked side not to have qualified, and Saudi Arabia, in 51st, caused a sensational upset by beating third-ranked Argentina in their opening game. Rank Nation Points  1 Brazil 1841.3  2 Belgium 1816.71  3 Argentina 1773.88  4 France 1759.78  5 England 1728.47  7 Spain 1715.22  8 Netherlands 1694.51  9 Portugal 1676.56  10 Denmark 1666.57  11 Germany 1650.21  12 Croatia 1645.64  13 Mexico 1644.89  14 Uruguay 1638.71  15 Switzerland 1635.92  16 USA 1627.48  18 Senegal 1584.38  19 Wales 1569.82  20 Iran 1564.61  21 Serbia 1563.62  22 Morocco 1563.5  24 Japan 1559.54  26 Poland 1548.59  28 South Korea 1530.3  30 Tunisia 1507.54  31 Costa Rica 1503.59  38 Australia 1488.72  41 Canada 1475  43 Cameroon 1471.44  44 Ecuador 1464.39  50 Qatar 1439.89  51 Saudi Arabia 1437.78  61 Ghana 1393 Which teams have been world number one? Only eight nations to date have been crowned world number one. Germany were top when rankings were first introduced with Brazil eventually replacing them. From there, Italy, France, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, and Belgium have all also enjoyed stints as world number one. France and Belgium became the first nations to share top spot when they did so briefly in late 2018. Does the top-ranked side win the World Cup? Surprisingly, the team ranked number one going into the World Cup has never won the tournament. Rankings have only been active since the 1994 World Cup, where Germany went in as leaders only to be replaced by eventual winners Brazil. In 1998, Brazil were still number one but were beaten 3-0 by France in that year's World Cup final. France were then top during the 2002 World Cup only for Brazil to bounce back and lift the title. Brazil were world number one going into the 2006 and 2010 tournaments but Italy and Spain both triumphed on those occasions. Spain were then top going into 2014 when Germany triumphed, who themselves were number one in 2018 when France took out the title. This trend has continued in 2022 with Brazil knocked out in the quarterfinals and now likely to lose their number one ranking. How are FIFA rankings calculated? FIFA rankings have existed since 1992 and uses a points-scoring system to work out standings. The method for calculating FIFA rankings was officially changed in August 2018. This new system works by adding or subtracting points from a team's previous total based on results rather than using an average number of points earned over a certain period. The number of points added or subtracted is influenced by the calibre of opponent a team faces. For example, beating a team ranked inside the top 10 will result in more points being gained than defeating a side ranked outside the top 20. The expected result of the game will also impact the number of points gained. Specific games are given more weight too, so winning a World Cup match will result in more points than claiming victory in an international friendly. Matches decided by penalty shootouts are a factor as well with losing teams given the same points as for a draw, while winners only get points equivalent to half a win. Losing knockout round matches of final competitions also won't result in teams losing any points. Here's a calculation example provided by FIFA: - Team A has 1300 points before the match and wins a continental qualifier against team B that has 1500 points - For team A the formula is: P=1300+25*(1‚Äì(1/(10 exp (-(1300‚Äì1500)/600) +1))) - For team B the formula is: P = 1500 + 25 * (0- (1 / (10 exp (-(1500-1300)/600) + 1))) - Thus, team A wins 17 points and has P = 1317 points after the match - Team B loses the same amount of points and thus ends up with 1483 points after the match FIFA rankings points system If the above example has you scratching your head, you're not alone. But understanding the points system a bit better should help with that. The 'importance co-efficient' plays a big part in determining just how many ranking points a team can earn from each fixture and is as follows: - 5 ‚Äì friendlies played outside the International Match Calendar windows - 10 ‚Äì friendlies played within the International Match Calendar windows - 15 ‚Äì UEFA Nations League matches (group stage) - 25 ‚Äì UEFA Nations League matches (playoffs and finals), Confederations' final competitions qualifiers, FIFA World Cup qualifiers - 35 ‚Äì Confederations' final competitions matches (before quarter-finals) - 40 ‚Äì Confederations' final competitions matches (quarter-finals and later) - 50 ‚Äì FIFA World Cup matches (before quarter-finals) - 60 ‚Äì FIFA World Cup matches (quarter-finals, semi-finals, third place play-off and final) The result of said match then combines with the expected result to determine what percentage of the above points are awarded. When are FIFA rankings updated? FIFA rankings are updated after each recognised international window. As such, they are generally revised several times a year depending on the FIFA calendar. This year, rankings will only be updated a total of six times with the final revision of 2022 to be made on December 22 after the World Cup in Qatar has concluded."
52,sport football france names 25 man squad for fifa world cup varane kimpembe and giroud picked article66118883,"France coach Didier Deschamps picked central defenders Raphael Varane and Prensel Kimpembe, but left out standout goalkeeper Mike Maignan in a World Cup squad announced Wednesday amid injury concerns. Deschamps announced his 25-man squad on national television. Defending champion France opens against Australia on November 22, and the squad flies to Qatar next Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe have a huge challenge ahead of us. Nothing is bigger than the World Cup. But I have total faith in my players,‚Äù Deschamps said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt change the physical form players are in. We play on the 22nd, so at least we have one week to prepare.‚Äù Veteran striker Olivier Giroud was selected after some fine performances for AC Milan this season. The 36-year-old striker needs three goals to beat Thierry Henry's national team record of 51. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs better for the France team that he‚Äôs with us,"" said Deschamps, adding that Giroud remains second choice behind Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema. ‚ÄúHe knows his status.‚Äù But Maignan ‚Äî Giroud's club teammate and the best goalkeeper in Serie A when Milan won the league last season ‚Äî was left out as he recovers from an ongoing calf injury. The 37-year-old Steve Mandanda takes his place as backup for No. 1 Hugo Lloris. Varane selected despite hamstring injury Varane, who has 87 international caps, has not played since sustaining a hamstring injury with Manchester United on October 11. He was a rock in France's defence when it won the 2018 World Cup. Kimpembe, a PSG defender who has 28 caps, has been hampered by a six-week hamstring injury and a recent Achilles Tendon problem. ‚ÄúPresnel will be ready (for PSG) on Sunday,‚Äù Deschamps said. ‚ÄúRaphael‚Äôs injury was a bit longer, but he could also be ready against Australia.‚Äù William Saliba, who has excelled for Premier League leader Arsenal this season, and Bayern Munich's Dayot Upamecano provide good cover in central defense. Marseille right back Jonathan Clauss was left out but teammate Jordan Veretout got the nod in a midfield lineup that includes Real Madrid pair Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni. ‚ÄúI saw quite a few World Cups in front of the TV with my family,"" the 22-year-old Tchouameni said. ""So hearing my name in the list bings back memories, and now I‚Äôm part of it."" Additional players allowed FIFA let teams add three players to the usual squads of 23 because of disruption to football during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some players have looked tense in recent weeks amid the fear of getting injured close to the tournament. ‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt been the easiest choice. But my fellow coaches have faced the same problems during this period,‚Äù Deschamps said. ‚ÄúPlayers have been getting injured and may still get injured.‚Äù Kante, Pogba unavailable France is without Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante because of injuries, depriving Deschamps of his two best midfielders from the 2018 World Cup. The 34-year-old Benzema, who has been dealing with muscle fatigue and a bothersome thigh, will miss his sixth straight start when Madrid hosts C√°diz in the Spanish league on Thursday. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said Benzema was not trying to preserve himself for France. Deschamps said he's overplayed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs played an enormous amount, maybe too much at one point. Karim knows that the World Cup is very important for him,"" Deschamps said. ""He hasn‚Äôt refused to play for Real Madrid, he just wasn‚Äôt in top form. He'll do everything to be ready for the 22nd.‚Äù Strong attack Deschamps has an attack packed with pace, skill and power. PSG star Kylian Mbappe joins Benzema, along with Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Ousmane Dembele (Barcelona), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) and Christopher Nkunku, who is enjoying another fine season with Leipzig. France lost to Switzerland in the round of 16 at the European Championship last year but bounced back to win the Nations League a few months later. But Deschamps thinks injury concerns could sharpen the focus. ‚ÄúFrench teams are not at their best when they‚Äôre in a comfort zone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say that we‚Äôre in one now.‚Äù France plays Australia at Al Janoub Stadium, then faces Denmark at Stadium 974 before completing its Group D matches against Tunisia on Nov. 30 at Education City Stadium. No team has successfully defended its World Cup title since Brazil in 1962. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to sap my morale,"" Deschamps told the television presenter when reminded. ""Reaching the highest level is a difficult thing, staying there is even more difficult.‚Äù France‚Äôs 25-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar Goalkeepers: Alphone Areola (West Ham), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Steve Mandanda (Rennes).

54,news international saudi king declares holiday after shock world cup win over argentina article66171373,"Saudi King Salman has declared a national holiday after the football team's stunning World Cup win on Tuesday over Argentina, state media reported. The 86-year-old monarch ""orders that tomorrow, Wednesday, be a holiday for all employees in the public and private sectors, as well as male and female students at all educational levels"", the Al-Ekhbariya channel said on Twitter. The move comes in the middle of final exams in the Gulf nation, indicating that they will have to be rescheduled. The Saudi Green Falcons bounced back from conceding an early Lionel Messi penalty to produce one of the greatest World Cup shocks thanks to a Saleh Al-Shehri equaliser and a sublime Salem Al-Dawsari winner at the Lusail Stadium in Doha. Celebrations in Riyadh Celebrations erupted throughout the capital Riyadh after the final whistle blew, with fans forming impromptu dance circles and waving the sword-emblazoned national flag from the windows of speeding cars. Al-Ekhbariya posted pictures of King Salman's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, celebrating after watching the game with a group that included energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. Turki al-Sheikh, an adviser at the Royal Court and head of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, announced on Twitter that admission fees would be waived at major theme parks and entertainment centres in Riyadh on Tuesday. Few could have predicted that Herve Renard's Green Falcons, ranked 51st in the world, would topple the twice-world champions led by the feted Messi, who has seven Ballons d'Or to his name. The team's next match is on Saturday against Poland."

59,sports 2022 11 22 the world cups most valuable teams which squads are worth most,"The World Cup‚Äôs most valuable teams: Which squads are worth most? England is the most valuable team at the Qatar World Cup 2022 with an estimated transfer value of some $1.54bn, study says. England have the most valuable squad at the Qatar World Cup 2022, with the team‚Äôs Jude Bellingham topping a list of more than 800 football players in terms of transfer value, a study has found. According to a study by Swiss research group CIES Football Observatory, England‚Äôs 26-man squad is worth just less than 1.5 billion euros ($1.54bn) in transfer value, with 19-year-old Bellingham valued at 202 million euros ($207.4m). The Borussia Dortmund player enhanced his reputation as one of the world‚Äôs top young players with a superb goal in England‚Äôs 6-2 victory over Iran in their World Cup tournament opener on Monday. Here is a look at how the other major football teams compare at the World Cup tournament: Transfer Value Brazil are second on the list after England with a transfer value of 1.45 billion euros ($1.49bn), and Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior was their most valuable player at 200 million euros ($205m). France were third with an estimated transfer value of 1.34 billion ($1.38bn) for their squad. Paris St Germain (PSG) forward Kylian Mbappe was their top player, with a value of 185 million euros ($190m). The top three were followed by Spain at 1.2 billion euros ($1.23bn), Portugal at 1.15 billion euros ($1.18bn) and Germany at 1.02 billion euros ($1.05bn). The CIES Football Observatory put the overall value of all the squads at the World Cup 2022 at 15 billion euros ($15.4bn) based on a statistical technique involving more than 2,000 transactions of players transferred from clubs in the five major European leagues during the period from July 2012 to November 2021. Insurable value: In terms of insurable value, England‚Äôs squad again topped the list of World Cup teams with an estimated insurable value of 3.17 billion pounds ($3.76bn), according to an analysis by Lloyd‚Äôs of London and backed by the Centre for Economics and Business Research. England edged out France at 2.66 billion pounds ($3.15bn) and Brazil at 2.56 billion pounds ($3.04bn) to claim the top spot. Lloyd‚Äôs said the assessment of insurable value comprises a variety of metrics such as wages, sponsorship, age and on-field positions. Bellingham was rated the most insurable player, followed by Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. Lloyd‚Äôs model is based on the belief that the quality of a team can be assessed by measuring factors such as player salaries, incomes from endorsements, and ages, as the value of a team is a good indicator of its talent on the pitch."
60,football fifa world cup news fifa world cup quarterfinal qatar 2022 referee antonio lahoz sent home messi controversy argentina vs netherlands article66254732,"Antonio Mateu Lahoz, the referee of the FIFA World Cup quarterfinal match between Argentina and Netherlands, was reportedly sent home after a disappointing performance in his final game in Qatar 2022. The quarterfinal clash at the Lusail Stadium saw a total of 19 bookings, breaking the record of the Portugal vs Netherlands round of 16 match in the 2006 World Cup, popularly known as the ‚ÄòBattle of Nuremberg.‚Äô Out of the 19 bookings, two were shown to Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni and support staff Walter Samuel. Netherlands full-back Denzel Dumfries was the only player to see a second yellow during the penalty shootout. Argentina captain Lionel Messi has slammed the referee after the match, calling him ‚Äònot up to the mark‚Äô. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about referees because then they will sanction you,‚Äù Messi said during the post-match interview with the organiser, ‚ÄúBut we were scared before the game because we knew what was coming [with Mateu Lahoz]. They cannot put a referee like that on this game when he is not up to the level,‚Äù he added. FIFA, however, did over disciplinary proceedings against the Argentina Football Federation after the remarks. ‚ÄúThe FIFA Disciplinary Committee has opened proceedings against the Argentinian Football Association due to potential breaches of articles 12 (Misconduct of players and officials) and 16 (Order and security at matches) of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the Netherlands vs Argentina FIFA World Cup match,‚Äù it said in a statement. In the World Cup 2022, Lahoz officiated three matches and issued 23 yellow cards, which comprised two group stage matches and one quarterfinal. He was in charge of the Qatar vs Senegal and USA vs Iran clashes, respectively. In two games, he issued a total of eight yellow cards."

But CR7 had to leave Qatar without the coveted trophy after Portugal's shock ext in the quarter-finals after 1-0 loss to Morocco.Lionel Messi has broken another World Cup record for Argentina (Natacha Pisarenko)Lionel Messi: Argentina's top scorer After scoring a fifth goal of this World Cup against Croatia, and his 11th overall, Lionel Messi smashed a new string of records for Argentina. The 35-year-old is now the top-scorer for Argentina in World Cups, surpassing the previous record of Gabriel Batistuta (10), joint-sixth in all-time World Cup scorer charts, and the oldest man to score five goals in a single World Cup tournament. The semi-final meeting with Croatia also saw him level Lothar Matthaus' record 25 World Cup appearances by a player before he overtook it in the final. In the tournament's opening stages, Messi became the first player to score in four World Cups for Argentina (2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022) after he netted a penalty in an opening-round loss to Saudi Arabia. In the final, he scored from the spot to become the first man to score in each of the knockout stages since the round of 16 was introduced at Mexico 1986. He scored in extra time to make it seven for the tournament and 13 in World Cups. But more than any of that, he lifted the World Cup for the first time in his glorious career.¬†¬† FIFA World Cup 2022: What records has Lionel Messi broken and what records is he closing in on?Kylian Mbappe celebrates his second goal in the final against Argentina (2022 Getty Images)Mbappe magic takes France to the brink of retaining their title With 10 minutes to go in the World Cup Final, Argentina led 2-0 with Messi on course for the one trophy to have eluded him. Kylian Mbappe had other ideas. First, he scored from the spot before sweeping home moments later to take the match into extra time. And after his PSG teammate had put Argentina back in front, Mbappe converted another penalty to join Geoff Hurst as the only man to score a hat-trick in the World Cup Final and force a penalty shoot-out. That took Mbappe's tally to eight for the tournament, securing the Golden Boot by one from Messi. He had already eclipsed Pele as the highest World Cup goalscorer before the age of 24. But that incredible effort proved in vain as Argentina won on penalties.Gavi was part of Spain's 7-0 rout over Costa Rica (GETTY IMAGES)Gavi: Spain's youthful history-maker Spain‚Äôs No.9 Gavi became the first player born in the year 2004 to score a goal in Qatar when his country thumped Costa Rica 7-0 in their opening match of the tournament. Incidentally, that victory is the record for the most goals Spain has ever scored in a single World Cup match.Olivier Giroud: France's all-time top scorer He's done it! With his goal at the end of the first half of France's round-of-16 clash against Poland, Olivier Giroud became France's all-time leading goalscorer with 52 goals, which he later extended to 53 with his headed winner in the quarter-final against England. The 36-year-old drew level with Thierry Henry's previous mark of 51 when he scored twice in the 4-1 win over Australia.Oliver Giroud celebrates his goal against Poland which made him France's all-time leading goalscorer (2022 Getty Images)Hugo Lloris: France's all-time top appearance maker Hot on the heels of Giroud's goal scoring feat, France's captain Hugo Lloris became his nation's record appearance maker. The Tottenham goalkeeper won his 143rd cap in the quarter-final win over England, moving him ahead of Lilian Thuram. Lloris took his tally to 144 in the semi-final against Morocco and then to 145 in the final.Saudi Arabia snap Argentina win-streak Argentina came to Qatar unbeaten in 36 games, singling them out as one of the favourite to win the entire competition. However, that run was shattered by the second-lowest ranked team at the tournament, Saudi Arabia, who defeated Argentina in 2-1.Inaki and Nico Williams: a sibling first Inaki Williams of Ghana and Nico Williams of Spain made FIFA World Cup history on 24 November after they became the first full siblings to play for different countries at the FIFA World Cup.Ecuador celebrate after scoring their second goal against Qatar on Sunday, 20 November (2022 Getty Images)Qatar: A first for the home team There's positive record-making and there's the less so, and unfortuantely for hosts Qatar, they claimed a first they might not want to brag too much about. In losing their first match 2-0 Ecuador, Qatar became the first hosts of a FIFA World Cup to lose their opening match.Wayne Hennessey sees red after an unlawful challenge in Wales' 2-0 loss to Iran (2022 Getty Images)Wayne Hennessey: First red in Qatar, third ever for a goalkeeper Wales' goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey became the first player at FIFA World Cup 2022 to see a red card after he collided with Iran's Mehdi Taremi.

Hennessey is now the third goalkeeper in World Cup history to be sent off with a red card.Record draws at World Cup and England's 22nd England and USA played out the fifth goalless draw of the FIFA World Cup 2022 on Friday (25 November). Six days later, Croatia and Belgium added another 0-0. The other four goalless draws so far: Mexico 0-0 Poland, Denmark 0-0 Tunisia, Croatia 0-0 Morocco and South Korea 0-0 Uruguay. Meaning Qatar 2022 has set another record, eight teams drawing the opening game 0-0 in the same World Cup for the first time ever. England's barren draw was the 22nd draw at World Cups which is a record. Italy is now second with 21 draws.Jordan Pickford (L) and Jordan Henderson of England applaud fans after the 0-0 draw during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Group B match between England and USA at Al Bayt Stadium on November 25, 2022 in Al Khor, Qatar.

Valencia scored all three of Ecuador's goals in the group stage of the World Cup in 2014. The South American side did not qualify for the 2018 edition in Russia. The 33-year-old joins a select group that includes Portugal's legend Eusebio in 1966, Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Russia's Oleg Salenko in 1994.Lewandowski finally ends World Cup drought Robert Lewandowski was in tears after scoring his first World Cup goal in Poland‚Äôs 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia. The Barcelona striker could not hide his emotions after doubling his side's lead with eight minutes remaining to seal victory for his side. The 34-year-old had gone five World Cup games without a goal and missed a penalty in his team‚Äôs opening Group C game against Mexico. Lewandowski now has over 600 career goals and equalled Pele's tally of 77 international strikes. His consolation penalty deep into injury time of the round-of-16 defeat to France saw him go one clear of the Brazilian legend.Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring Poland's second goal against Saudi Arabia (2022 Getty Images)Pepe second oldest outfield player and scorer Portugal's 39-year old centre-back Pepe has become the second oldest outfield player in World Cup after starting in his country's 2-0 win over Uruguay, Cameroon's Roger Milla remains the oldest as he suited up in the World Cup 1994 in the USA aged 42.

Alves has now surpassed him. But Silva made World Cup history on his own as the Chelsea star bagged an assist during Brazil's 4-1 win against the Republic of Korea thus becoming the oldest player to assist a goal at the tournament.Thiago Silva (2022 Getty Images)Morocco become first African nation ever to advance to World Cup semi-finals Morocco has reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in history after beating Portugal 1-0 on Saturday (10 December).

And Morocco are clinical from the spot too, with their goalie Yassine Bounou (aka Bono) saving two penalties in the epic 3-0 shootout win over Spain in the last 16.

Lohoz also yellow-carded Argentina's coach Lionel Scaloni and his assistant coach Walter Samuel. The only player to receive two yellows was Dutch star Denzel Dumfries, the second coming AFTER Lautaro Martinez had converted the decisive penalty in the shootout.More FIFA World Cup 2022 stats Brazil went a record 17 group games unbeaten at the FIFA World Cup before going down to Cameroon. Canada are the 76th different team to score at a men's FIFA World Cup. Canada's Alphonso Davies scored the fastest goal at Qatar 2022. He scored inside 70 seconds vs Croatia.

Cristiano Ronaldo, at 37 years and 292 days, became the oldest player to score for Portugal at the World Cup. Lionel Messi scored his 11th World Cup goal in 25 matches making him his country's leading scorer at World Cups.

Messi set a record for most World Cup appearances for Argentina (25) surpassing Diego Maradona (21). Lionel Messi holds the record of never being eliminated from a group stage of a tournament for both club and country. Mexico failed to advance out of the group stage for the first time since 1978. Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made his 100th appearance for Belgium, but his tournament was over after the group stage. Tunisia's Wahbi Khazri is the first African player in World Cup history to score in three consecutive starts. With 17.7 per cent vs Spain, Japan won a FIFA World Cup game with the lowest possession figure recorded in football World Cup history. Cameroon's Vincent Aboubakar scored the only goal in his side's historic 1-0 win over Brazil but was sent off for removing his shirt celebrating the goal. He is the first player to score and be sent off in a World Cup match since Zinedine Zidane in the 2006 final vs Italy. Lionel Messi finally managed his first goal in the knockout stage at the World Cup when he scored the opener in his country's 2-1 win over Australia in the round of 16. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made his 143rd appearance for France in the quarter-final win over England. That put him one clear of Lilian Thuram as France's most capped player. Croatia's Ivan Perisic became his country's all-time leading scorer at major tournaments with 10 goals. The striker scored the equaliser against Japan, before his side went on to win 3-1 on penalties. Lionel Messi is the first male football player to score and assist in three different World Cup games in a single tournament since 1966 after leading his team to a 3-0 rout of Croatia in the semi-finals. Argentina maintained their record of never having lost a World Cup semi-final with their victory over Croatia. They have featured in that stage of the tournament now five times. They are also only the fifth team ever to reach a World Cup final after losing their opening game. Lionel Messi became the first man to score in each of the knockout stages since the round of 16 was introduced at Mexico 1986. Kylian Mbappe became the fifth man to score in more than one World Cup Final. Kylian Mbappe became just the second man to score a hat-trick in the World Cup Final, the first being England's Geoff Hurst in 1966.

FIFA World Cup 2022 Short Review: Best and worst of the tournament in Qatar  BEST PLAYER ‚Äî‚Äî Lionel Messi won the 2022 FIFA Golden Ball as the tournament‚Äôs best player, while scoring seven goals, providing three assists and being Argentina‚Äôs star player in all seven of its matches.  BIGGEST FLOP ‚Äî‚Äî  Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo have had a worse tournament in his Entire Career. OK, he converted a penalty against Ghana to become the first man to score at five different World Cups, but nothing else went right for the player currently without a club. Ronaldo was benched against Switzerland and Morocco in the knockout stage due to bad attitude with his coach. BEST GOAL ‚Äî‚Äî Brazil striker Richarlison had his back to the goal when he used one touch to flick the ball up in the air near the penalty spot, as the Brazilean sealed a 2-0 win over Serbia in the group stage. BEST SAVE ‚Äî‚Äî There were 20 seconds remaining of stoppage time in extra time in the 2022 world cup final when French striker Randal Kolo Muani went clean through on Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martinez.   BEST MATCH ‚Äî‚Äî Argentina was involved in the best two. First, the team‚Äôs quarterfinal match against the Netherlands had it all ‚Äî late drama through a goal in the 11th minute of stoppage time to make it 2-2, a penalty shootout, a World Cup-record 17 yellow cards and a red card after the whistle. THEN, At the END, came the "" Battle of Lusail"" happened in World Cup Fina, which might have just topped it.  MOST DISAPPOINTING TEAM ‚Äî‚Äî Belgium entered as the second-ranked team and with some of the most famous players in the world. They scored Just one goal, didn‚Äôt get out of their group ‚Äî‚Äî Germany exiting from the group stage for the second straight World Cup is a close second. BEST FANS ‚Äî‚Äî Morocco‚Äôs for the noise, Argentina‚Äôs for the pure passion, and Japan‚Äôs for the way they tidy up after themselves.  BEST QUOTE ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúI had the feeling that this was the one.‚Äù ‚Äî Lionel Messi after winning the World Cup for the first time. ___ The FIFA World Cup Stunning Images: Remarkable Best Photos from Qatar 2022 tournament.

73,com football kylian mbappe becomes second player to score hattrick in fifa world cup final 204785.html,"com football kylian mbappe becomes second player to score hattrick in fifa world cup final 204785.html.  Kylian Mbappe becomes second player to score hattrick in FIFA World Cup final By Mark Hoover Published: Monday, December 19, 2022, 1:00 [IST] Lusail, December 19: Kylian Mbappe on Sunday (December 18) became the second player ever to score a hattrick in the FIFA World Cup Final, but the Frenchman could not help his nation win a second World Cup in a row. The treble also made the 23-year-old Frenchman the second player and the first since England's Geoff Hurst scored a hattrick against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup Final. by TaboolaSponsored Links Born With A Heart Condition, Sopiga Needs Surgery To Live. Ketto Learn More Belly Fat Removal Without Surgery in Cherthala: The Price Might Surprise You Laser Liposuction | Sponsored Results The hattrick helped Mbappe clinch the World Cup Golden Boot, but his efforts went in vain as Lionel Messi's Argentina triumphed on penalties. FIFA World Cup 2022: Full List of Award Winners, Golden Boot, Golden Ball, Golden Glove, Prize Money and Stats Mbappe entered Sunday's game level with Paris Saint-Germain team-mate Messi on five goals, and twice fell behind in his battle with the Argentina captain in a thrilling contest. How Mbappe Hattrick Came About Messi became the first player to reach 20 World Cup goal involvements when he opened the scoring from the spot following Ousmane Dembele's trip on Angel Di Maria, who then capped a flowing move to put Argentina 2-0 up heading into half time. However, Mbappe was gifted a route back into the battle atop the goalscoring charts with 10 minutes remaining, tucking a penalty home after Nicolas Otamendi fouled Randal Kolo Muani. Mbappe then moved clear in the race for the Golden Boot in incredible fashion 97 seconds later, lashing a first-time volley beyond Emiliano Martinez to force extra time via his second goal. Messi looked to have sealed the award - and the trophy for his country - once again when he prodded Argentina back in front in extra time, but Mbappe responded with yet another spot-kick when Gonzalo Montiel was penalised for handball. But all that went in vain in the shootout, which Argentina sealed 4-2. Mbappe FIFA World Cup Final Most Goals Records Having netted in 2018's win against Croatia, Mbappe is now the highest-scoring player in World Cup final history with four, while his overall tally of 12 goals at the tournament puts him level with three-time champion Pele. Mbappe's total of eight goals in Qatar is the joint highest at a single World Cup since Gerd Muller scored 10 times in 1970 (also Ronaldo, eight in 2002), but that will come as little consolation to the forward following France's painful defeat. Mbappe also became the youngest player to reach double figures at the finals - aged 23 years 363 days - surpassing Muller's record (24 years, 226 days).

75,m fifaplus en articles enzo fernandez the rapid rise of argentinas award winning youngster,"m fifaplus en articles enzo fernandez the rapid rise of argentinas award winning youngster. Enzo Fernandez: The rapid rise of Argentina's award-winning youngster We look at how the Argentina midfielder came from nowhere to win the FIFA Young Player award at Qatar 2022. Enzo Fernandez: A midfield maestro with a warrior's heart Learn how the Argentina star developed into the player and man he is today from his former youth coach at River Plate. Enzo Fernandez received the FIFA Young Player award at Qatar 2022 The Argentina midfielder was a key man throughout the knockout phase Rising star has described playing with Lionel Messi as ìa dream come trueî A modest, almost bashful smile came over Enzo Fernandezís face as he climbed the podium to receive the Qatar 2022 FIFA Young Player award. Collecting the prize meant the dynamic midfielder was momentarily separated from his jubilant team-mates, celebrating wildly at the side of the presentation stage following the greatest World Cup final of them all. As the scene unfolded, Fernandez could be forgiven for having a look of slight disbelief in his eyes. The 21-year-oldís story is among the most remarkable from this unforgettable World Cup. FIFA World Cupô? 2022 Best Young Player: Enzo Fernandez Argentina's Enzo Fernandez is handed the trophy for the Best Young Player at the 2022 FIFA World Cupô? in Qatar. Fernandez only made his senior international debut in September, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3-0 friendly win over Honduras. The occasion saw Fernandez fulfil a lifelong ambition to play alongside his idol, Lionel Messi. ìTo play with Leo brings me enormous joy,î said Fernandez, in the aftermath of that game. ìItís a dream come true.î Less than three months later and Messi would be describing Fernandez as a ìspectacular kidî, with the pair instrumental figures in Argentinaís world-champion side. Fernandez secured his place in Lionel Scaloniís Qatar 2022 squad following further mature displays in two pre-tournament friendlies ñ and having continued to excel for club side Benfica. His rare combination of boundless energy, immaculate technique and tactical intelligence has seen him swiftly acclimatise to European football following his move from boyhood club River Plate this summer. He has been a near ever-present for a Benfica side which has swept all before them at home and abroad this season. The team remain unbeaten across 28 matches in all competitions and finished top of a UEFA Champions League group featuring Messiís Paris Saint-Germain. At just 21, Fernandezís capacity to dictate the tempo of the game marks him out as a special talent. The youngster's passing is crisp, incisive and precise ñ his accuracy rate is 90 per cent in league matches this term and was 88 per cent during the World Cup. His ability to contribute in the final third, meanwhile, is underlined by the five assists and three goals he has already racked up for Benfica. Argentina v Mexico | Group C | FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022ô | Highlights Watch the highlights from the match between Argentina and Mexico played at Lusail Stadium, Lusail on Saturday, 26 November 2022. Fernandezís ball-striking ability, of course, was memorably displayed in Argentinaís do-or-die group-stage win over Mexico, when he expertly curled a shot into the top corner of Guillermo Ochoaís net to seal a 2-0 victory. He had come on as a substitute in that game but would start every remaining match of Argentinaís triumphant World Cup campaign. His introduction into coach Scaloniís line-up coincided with Argentina steadily growing in stature and belief. Dovetailing impressively with midfield colleagues Alexis Mac Allister and Rodrigo De Paul, Fernandezís tigerish tackling and competitive spirit added intensity to La Albicelesteís performances. Indeed, his total of 22 successful tackles was surpassed by only two players across the World Cup (Mateo Kovacic and Achraf Hakimi). Fernandez was at his all-action best in the showpiece final as Argentina overwhelmed France in the opening 70 minutes of the contest. Kylian Mbappe would then turn the game on its head as the match developed into an all-time classic, but Fernandezís Argentina dug deep into their reserves of resilience and determination to eventually triumph in the most dramatic circumstances. Argentina v France | Final | FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022ô | Highlights Watch the highlights from the match between Argentina and France played at Lusail Stadium, Lusail on Sunday, 18 December 2022. The midfielderís significant influence on this Argentina team is highlighted by the fact he was one of only five members of Scaloniís side to play the full 120 minutes of the final. Moments after receiving his richly deserved FIFA Young Player award, Fernandezís sheepish smile transformed into one of unbridled joy as he re-joined his team-mates for the World Cup presentation. Six years previously, Fernandez penned an open letter on Facebook to the man about to hoist that trophy high into the sky, urging his hero to reconsider retirement from international football. ìPlease donít go, Leo,î he wrote. ìSeeing you play with the light blue and white is the greatest pride in the world. Stay and have fun.î Thankfully, for Enzo ñ for every football lover ñ Lionel Messi did just that, going on to win the greatest prize of all. And with the help of a young midfielder with the world at his feet."
